There are numerous looped sound effects, called ambients.  Most of them are the same and simply change the default sound file that is played.  Alternatively, `ambient_custom_looping` can be used in place of any of these so long as you know what sound file to specify.

Some sounds are looping, others are non-looped sounds played via trigger.  Some ambients play non-looped sounds that get played at randomized intervals.  Certain specialized ambients will play multiple different randomly picked non-looped sounds at randomized intervals; these are typically named `ambient_custom_` at the beginning of their name, such as `ambient_custom_wind` or `ambient_custom_wood`.  These features are extremely popular and have many different various implementations in almost all mods.

# Standard Ambient Noises
These are simply static location, looping sound effects that play the same sound file over and over indefinitely.  These can have their volume and falloff adjusted at map start but cannot be changed once the level has finished starting.

### All of the following entities in this table have these common attributes:
`spawnflags` - Set 8 Global to play this ambient sound everywhere all the time.  Not recommended unless for small maps in between larger levels.
`volume` - Set to a value from 0 to 1, 0 is silent, 1 is full volume. 0.5 is default for the ambients in the table below.
`speed` - Set to one of the following to specify the falloff attenuation.  This affects the distance the sound will be heard.
> * 0: Plays everywhere (same as setting `spawnflags` 8 above)
> * 1: Default
> * 2: Idle (not as noticeable)
> * 3: Static (bit shorter)
> * 4: Quiet (small radius, still barely audible at longer distances but fades out quicker)
