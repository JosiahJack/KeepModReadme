There is a plenary collection of deities and household teraphim.  Travelers may choose to pay their respects by lighting a candle and thus receive a blessing.  It is important to distinguish between <em>teraphim</em>, who serve as physical representatives of deities and <em>idols</em>, who are treated as deities of themselves.  However, one may alternatively disregard such lesser deities and distinctions entirely and pay respects to a higher deity by counting these shrines as unholy, desecrating them by smashing them to receive an alternative blessing from an elder god.  What one does must be considered carefully, even atheistically ignoring shrines may have consequences.</p>\n<h3 id=\"benefits\">Benefits<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#benefits\"></a></h3>\n<p>These are the shrine benefits.  Detailed per <code>style</code> benefits given in the chart further down.</p>\n<p><strong>Respects</strong> are paid simply by walking up to a shrine's table structure.  The candle(s) will be lit by trigger.</p>\n<p><strong>Desecration</strong> is performed by destroying the shrine table.  Desecration after Respects will remove the respect blessing and may possibly be met with even stronger consequences.  Desecration affects all players in coop.</p>\n<p>Blessings are only granted for that level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"construction-standards\">Construction Standards<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#construction-standards\"></a></h3>\n<p>All shrines must have at least one candle placed mostly centered on a 32 high table structure with a thin <code>trigger_once</code> that is sized 8x32x32, with the trigger thinnest at the table front, touching the table, trigger top surface flush with tabletop, and trigger centered with the table.  The candle should start off by setting <code>spawnflags</code> 1 and giving a <code>targetname</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>trigger_once</code> must target an <code>info_shrine</code> with a <code>style</code> type set, while the table shall be a <code>func_breakable</code> that targets the same <code>info_shrine</code>.  When an <code>info_shrine</code> is targeted, it checks if the target is a player for Respects, or a breakable for Desecration.</p>\n<p>Shrine theming should be consistent with the guide in the chart below; arrangement, details, and shape at mapper discretion.  Use of a shrine prefabs as-is is fine, though <code>message</code> should be changed to suit your map's story.</p>\n<p><code>info_shrine</code> should be placed above the table, ideally in a place that makes sense as a point from which aura effects emanate.  This is the center of the aura, so place accordingly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"story-elements\">Story Elements<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#story-elements\"></a></h3>\n<p>Shrines have a god associated with them that a mapper specifies with <code>message</code>.  Associated <code>&#x3C;blessing></code> is in the chart below with a different blessing message for when a shrine is respected or desecrated.\nWhen blessed, the centerprint displayed will display a message like so:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;god>\nof the &#x3C;style> Shrine has blessed\nyou with &#x3C;blessing> \n</code></pre>\n<p>Or</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;god>\nof the &#x3C;style> Shrine has lost influence,\nthe Elder God blesses with\n&#x3C;blessing> \n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"aura\">Aura<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#aura\"></a></h3>\n<p>Auras apply the effects in the chart below to any players within the aura.  The aura effects are applied once every <code>delay</code> seconds for an amount of <code>cnt</code>.  Any monsters who are not of EVIL <code>alignment</code> will always receive healing at the same rate as the <code>delay</code> and <code>cnt</code> and also receive an increase in their pain timer to 5 seconds past the current time, so they won't go into any pain flinch animations while within the aura and can continue to consistently help players.  Monster benefits are the same regardless of <code>style</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"blessings\">Blessings<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#blessings\"></a></h3>\n<p>Blessings are always the same according to below, but the response to actions is map specific based on the <code>target</code> set on the <code>info_shrine</code>.  Best practice is for desecration to target delay spawned monsters who have <code>nomonstercount</code> of 1 so that shrines who aren't desecrated still show all monsters have been killed.</p>\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<table><thead><tr><th>Shrine Type</th><th><code>style</code></th><th>Rune Sign</th><th>Respect Blessing</th><th>Desecration Blessing</th><th>Theme Requirements</th><th>Recommended Decorations</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Earth</td><td>0</td><td>Green</td><td>\"Aura of Earth Magick,\\nbecome as stone.\" Grants aura that rapidly provides armor to nearby players and player followers and removes poison buffs, 1 armor per every 0.3 secs.

Within these dusty pages you may find a detailed technical explanation of what I have discovered and kept on my many travels in the land of Quake.\n\nWhat started as an effort to add a few items from both mission packs into one single player level eventually grew over time to be a massive compilation of features from across the Quake community.\nThis mod for the first [Quake (1996)](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake) is primarily a full combination of the following mods’ enemies, weapons, items, traps, and other features in addition to\nmy own features:\n* Standard Quake (ID1)........[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake)]\n* Mission Pack 1 (Hipnotic)...[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake_Mission_Pack_1:_Scourge_of_Armagon)]\n* Mission Pack 2 (Rogue)......[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake_Mission_Pack_2:_Dissolution_of_Eternity)]\n* Arcane Dimensions (AD) [[link](http://www.simonoc.com/pages/design/sp/ad.htm)] [[mirror](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/ad_v1_80p1final.html)]\n* Drake (SOE, etc.) [[link](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/something_wicked.html)]\n* Quoth [[quoth 1](https://www.quaddicted.com/webarchive/kell.quaddicted.com/) [[quoth 2.2](https://tomeofpreach.wordpress.com/quoth/)]\n* Kinn (Marcher, etc.) [[marcher](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/kinn_marcher.html) [[bastion](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/kinn_bastion.html)]\n* Custents [[link](https://www.quakewiki.net/quake-1/mods/custents-custom-entities/)]\n* extras_r5 [[link](https://github.com/khreathor/extras_r5)] [[extras_r4 (older)](https://www.quakewiki.net/quake-1/mods/extras-r4/)] [[docs](http://khreathor.xyz/jam/extras/index.html)]\n* Nehahra [[link](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/nehahra.html)]\n* Rubicon and Rubicon 2 [[rubicon](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/rubicon.html)] [[rubicon2](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/rubicon2.html)] [[rrp](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/rrp.html)]\n* Other various community contributions, refer to the Credits\n\n\nArcane Dimensions serves as the primary base for all added content due to its excellent formatting, enhanced enemy infighting code, and excellent structure.\n\nAny conflicts have been resolved in such a manner as to retain the unique features of the primary mods above, for instance by using spawnflags, such that any mod's conflicting variant is avaialable.\nThe entity definition file (.fgd) contains all the necessary fields and spawnflags for accessing these conflict resolving features as well as any Keep specific features that have been added.\n\nAll features of this mod are documented here in their various sections.  A complete entity list can be found in the appendix.  In every section the entities are listed alphabetically by entity name.\n\nFor what is and isn't implemented, refer to the [Checklist](https://github.com/JosiahJack/Keep/blob/master/KeepFeatureChecklist.xlsx)\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe purpose of this mod is to provide a toolset for creating any kind of Quake\nmap you desire with anything you may have encountered in some of the best known\nmods.  This mod is a mod for mappers, intended for mappers to make excellent\nmaps for players to play.  Also, in the spirit of the earliest days of Quake,\nthis mod is not striving for overall quality, nor quantity, but is intending to\nprovide fun.  Some content is intentionally as-is, in terms of quality, to\npreserve the old-school 90's feel; other content is much more polished.  The\nquality of content you use is up to you, the mapper.\n\n> The mapper is always right.  The player is at the mercy of the mapper.\n\n# TABLE OF CONTENTS\nHere are links to each book within the tome.\n\n* [[general]]\n* [[credits]]\n* [[enemies]]\n* [[weapons]]\n* [[items]]\n* [[traps]]\n* [[brush-entities]]\n* [[point-entities]]\n* [[requirements]]\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nDISCLAIMERS:\nThe contents herein may have originally derived from other authors.  I make no claim that the full contents are an original work, rather only the compilation as such is original.
