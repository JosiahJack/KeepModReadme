### `weapon_lava_nailgun`

### Normal Effects
Lava variant of the Nailgun.  Fires red hot nails that pierce armor.  Weapon
causes fire damage so certain monsters have resistance to fire damage.  Only
does 9 damage against players.  Added weapon pickup model which wasn't
originally in Rogue.

### Tome of Power Effects
Changes to hitscan with double rate of fire.  Impact effects toss small flame
embers and have 100% chance of setting hit enemies on fire.

Fire applies 4 damage every second for a total time of damage / 4.  Then does
3, 2, 1 damage for 3 seconds as it fizzles out.
