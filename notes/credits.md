## Keep itself
Since this is a compilation mod, it has had development by a large number of
different people over the past 25 years of Quake modding history.  This first
section lists just the credit for the compilation itself, authors of its custom
additions that are unique to Keep.

Consider each and every one of these as a sincerest thank you.  You all are
amazing!

### Keep Credits - Coupled with Mjölnir
As Mjölnir is the primary user of Keep much in the same way that Tronyn's early
projects were the primary users of Drake, the Mjölnir team is intertwined with
Keep's development, especially over these last few years, to bring about the
most amazing maps and features ever seen in Quake.  The combined efforts of any
who helped to make both Mjölnir and to make Keep itself and its content are
thus given below.  Please see [Mjölnir](TODO Add link).

- W. Josiah Jack (Qmaster) - for co-lead, the compilation, code, modeling,
  this readme, testing, level design, more code, texturing, support
- Dustin Geeraert (Tronyn) - for co-lead, bulk level design, more level design, 
  even crazier amount of level design, and all the crazy cool ideas Qmaster was
  crazy enough to actually implement
- Ryanscissorhands - for weapons code with an early version of Arms of Asgard
- Madfox - for textures and modeling of so many cool things even Qmaster
  couldn't keep up

### Special note for Mjölnir:
The completion of this free, open-source, and totally non-commercial game
project has been made possible by the 2021 support of the [University of
Manitoba Department of Icelandic Language and Literature](https://umanitoba.ca/arts/icelandic), Faculty of Arts
(Endowment Fund) and English Department (DETFM).  Thanks to PJ Buchan and
Catari Gauthier of the Icelandic Department, and to Katrín Nielsdóttir and Ryan
E. Johnson of [The Icelandic Collection](https://libguides.lib.umanitoba.ca/c.php?g=723161), where Mackenzie Stewart's World Map
painting and other contents of this project were displayed as part of [Creation
Myths of the North in Fall of 2022](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ox6xa6qi6jpspv7/Icelandic.Department.Christmas.Newsletter.pdf?dl=0)

Reiterating that this is primarily a compilation mod, at least in terms of
content quantity, the following sections will list the credits for all of the
mods and projects used.

I have attempted to be thorough here, no etc.'s allowed, but please email me
if I left your name out of this list.  Also of note, I have included all the
various readmes from the different mods used in Keep into the `keep/credits`
folder.

The credits listed below were taken from the respective readmes of each release
or in cases where no readme was present from the sources I obtained them from.

Care has been taken to include all names and teams credited in each respective
mod within the `Per Project Credit Listing` below to ensure that each mod has
its credits intact.

The full name listing below is the complete compilation of all individuals
named who contributed to any of the mods and projects included, no matter how
trivial there contribution.  In some respects this will be a (not comprehensive
but quite large) list of people who have touched Quake in significant ways over
these many years since 1996.

## Sourced Projects/Mods List Alphabatized
Please note this excludes single authors releasing files individually (e.g.
Madfox).  For that see the authors list at the bottom of the page.  Some of
these are single map releases.  This lists all mods used in full or in part,
even if just one file or sky was used, even if not implemented and files are
available for later planned implementation.

Also note that while a mod is listed, it may only have contributed a tiny part
to Keep and may not be fully subsumed into the collective as of yet.

Parentheses contain the abbreviation commonly associated with a project.

## Per Project Credit Listing
Here I provide the credits for each mod as provided at the time of mod release
from the mods' documentation.  Please note this is the people, not the mods.
There is some recursion here as mods build on each other.

The mods here are listed alphabetically with the exception of AD.  Within each
mod the names are listed as they are found in the mod's documentation or as I
discovered it.
