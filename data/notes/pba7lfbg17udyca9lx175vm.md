Archer knight that shoots arrows with a bow.  Aims for bit before firing; will
avoid firing if there is someone in the way who is friendly and wait for a
clear shot.

 > Model is based on the archer from Hexen2.  AI used is mostly Quake's with
 > bit of Hexen2's.  Fancy moves such as ducking and sidestepping are NOT used, 
 > since it is so un-Quake (and I simply want a medieval style grunt/enforcer).
 > Holding his shot after drawing the bow, along with much of the shooting AI, 
 > was ported over.  -- Patrick Martin
