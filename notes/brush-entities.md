There are two types of entities in Quake, brush based and point based.  Brush 
based entities are listed here.  These are constructed out of brushes in a
level editor and compiled into the level's .bsp file.

> Technical Note: The normal world is itself a brush entity called `worldspawn`
(See [[general.world]]).
