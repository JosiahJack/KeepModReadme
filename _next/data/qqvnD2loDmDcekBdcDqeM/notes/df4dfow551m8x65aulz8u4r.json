Anything that does not meet these requirements is a bug to be fixed at some point.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Load original maps from included mod without any listed errors in the console.</li>\n<li>Have original maps from included mods playable from start to finish without any noticeable errors.  Minor console prints, warnings, and errors during playthrough are acceptable so long as the map is playable without any noticeable negative consequences by the player.</li>\n<li>Have all conflicting features from multiple mods that include same named entities as settable options.</li>\n<li>Any conflicts in naming are resolved without errors or warnings.</li>\n<li>A suitable default for any conflicting features or named entities, e.g. monsters with same names, shall be chosen with deference to the most recent mod unless an older mod is more fun or more feature complete, then it shall be the default.</li>\n<li>Have all settable options from mods available, except where such is impossible to do at scale for all monsters or would be impossible to be consistent at scale or would be unnoticeable by most players if implemented or not.</li>\n<li>All monsters should be placeable as-is without needing special setups.  A special setup would be requiring a monster to be targeted, requiring any helper entities such as paths or teleport locations or precaching minion setup entities.</li>\n<li>Any incorrectly set variables shall fail gracefully, printing a warning without crashing, without exiting to console, and without deleting the entity.  If an entity would have been removed in an error state in other mods, here Keep shall preserve the entity and set it up in a default state rather than remove it.</li>\n<li>All variable ranges shall be given in the documentation (this wiki).</li>\n<li>All variable types shall be given in the documentation.</li>\n<li>All variables' defaults shall be listed in the documentation.  If a default is not listed, it shall be assumed to be 0.</li>\n<li>Any time the phrase \"not set\" or \"off\" is used, it is assumed to have value 0 unless otherwise specified, and any otherwise cases shall be listed specifically.</li>\n<li>Where helpful or useful, even if default is a standard engine default such as 0, a description shall be given for what that default does.</li>\n<li>Full credit shall be given for each included mod.  This shall be done at a minimum by including the readme as it was previously included within the credits folder.</li>\n<li>Trivial single file readmes will be renamed to \"readme_modname\" replacing the 'modname' portion with the actual name of the mod for organizational purposes.  Any mod with nontrivial readme shall have such go, unmodified and not renamed inside a folder named with the mod's name and inside credits folder.</li>\n<li>Mods who were only ever included with maps shall have the particular release package's readme included and renamed acording to the above method.  Mods without specified names will default to the release package's name.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/\">TOME OF KEEP MOD</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","title":"TOME OF KEEP MOD","desc":"","updated":1682424325599,"created":1657642701590,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"KeepModReadme"},"contentHash":"4c52ea882ee2e021d34960efe1b0ae09","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"general","position":{"start":{"line":73,"column":3,"offset":4311},"end":{"line":73,"column":14,"offset":4322},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"general"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"credits","position":{"start":{"line":74,"column":3,"offset":4325},"end":{"line":74,"column":14,"offset":4336},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"credits"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"enemies","position":{"start":{"line":75,"column":3,"offset":4339},"end":{"line":75,"column":14,"offset":4350},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"enemies"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"weapons","position":{"start":{"line":76,"column":3,"offset":4353},"end":{"line":76,"column":14,"offset":4364},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"weapons"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"items","position":{"start":{"line":77,"column":3,"offset":4367},"end":{"line":77,"column":12,"offset":4376},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"items"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"traps","position":{"start":{"line":78,"column":3,"offset":4379},"end":{"line":78,"column":12,"offset":4388},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"traps"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"brush-entities","position":{"start":{"line":79,"column":3,"offset":4391},"end":{"line":79,"column":21,"offset":4409},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"brush-entities"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"point-entities","position":{"start":{"line":80,"column":3,"offset":4412},"end":{"line":80,"column":21,"offset":4430},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"point-entities"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"requirements","position":{"start":{"line":81,"column":3,"offset":4433},"end":{"line":81,"column":19,"offset":4449},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"requirements"}}],"anchors":{"current-version":{"type":"header","text":"Current Version:","value":"current-version","line":7,"column":0,"depth":4},"compiled-and-edited-by-w-josiah-jack-aka-qmaster--aug-23-2008-to-2024":{"type":"header","text":"Compiled and Edited by W.

Within these dusty pages you may find a detailed technical explanation of what I have discovered and kept on my many travels in the land of Quake.\n\nWhat started as an effort to add a few items from both mission packs into one single player level eventually grew over time to be a massive compilation of features from across the Quake community.\nThis mod for the first [Quake (1996)](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake) is primarily a full combination of the following modsâ€™ enemies, weapons, items, traps, and other features in addition to\nmy own features:\n* Standard Quake (ID1)........[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake)]\n* Mission Pack 1 (Hipnotic)...[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake_Mission_Pack_1:_Scourge_of_Armagon)]\n* Mission Pack 2 (Rogue)......[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake_Mission_Pack_2:_Dissolution_of_Eternity)]\n* Arcane Dimensions (AD) [[link](http://www.simonoc.com/pages/design/sp/ad.htm)] [[mirror](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/ad_v1_80p1final.html)]\n* Drake (SOE, etc.) [[link](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/something_wicked.html)]\n* Quoth [[quoth 1](https://www.quaddicted.com/webarchive/kell.quaddicted.com/) [[quoth 2.2](https://tomeofpreach.wordpress.com/quoth/)]\n* Kinn (Marcher, etc.) [[marcher](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/kinn_marcher.html) [[bastion](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/kinn_bastion.html)]\n* Custents [[link](https://www.quakewiki.net/quake-1/mods/custents-custom-entities/)]\n* extras_r5 [[link](https://github.com/khreathor/extras_r5)] [[extras_r4 (older)](https://www.quakewiki.net/quake-1/mods/extras-r4/)] [[docs](http://khreathor.xyz/jam/extras/index.html)]\n* Nehahra [[link](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/nehahra.html)]\n* Rubicon and Rubicon 2 [[rubicon](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/rubicon.html)] [[rubicon2](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/rubicon2.html)] [[rrp](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/rrp.html)]\n* Other various community contributions, refer to the Credits\n\n\nArcane Dimensions serves as the primary base for all added content due to its excellent formatting, enhanced enemy infighting code, and excellent structure.\n\nAny conflicts have been resolved in such a manner as to retain the unique features of the primary mods above, for instance by using spawnflags, such that any mod's conflicting variant is avaialable.\nThe entity definition file (.fgd) contains all the necessary fields and spawnflags for accessing these conflict resolving features as well as any Keep specific features that have been added.\n\nAll features of this mod are documented here in their various sections.  A complete entity list can be found in the appendix.  In every section the entities are listed alphabetically by entity name.\n\nFor what is and isn't implemented, refer to the [Checklist](https://github.com/JosiahJack/Keep/blob/master/KeepFeatureChecklist.xlsx)\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe purpose of this mod is to provide a toolset for creating any kind of Quake\nmap you desire with anything you may have encountered in some of the best known\nmods.  This mod is a mod for mappers, intended for mappers to make excellent\nmaps for players to play.  Also, in the spirit of the earliest days of Quake,\nthis mod is not striving for overall quality, nor quantity, but is intending to\nprovide fun.  Some content is intentionally as-is, in terms of quality, to\npreserve the old-school 90's feel; other content is much more polished.  The\nquality of content you use is up to you, the mapper.\n\n> The mapper is always right.  The player is at the mercy of the mapper.\n\n# TABLE OF CONTENTS\nHere are links to each book within the tome.\n\n* [[general]]\n* [[credits]]\n* [[enemies]]\n* [[weapons]]\n* [[items]]\n* [[traps]]\n* [[brush-entities]]\n* [[point-entities]]\n* [[requirements]]\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nDISCLAIMERS:\nThe contents herein may have originally derived from other authors.  I make no claim that the full contents are an original work, rather only the compilation as such is original.  Please refer to the\nSource Mod specified on each item's listing and refer to the credits folder for the original authors of some content.  Most content is GPL licensed since original Quake qc code and engine were\nrelease under said grandfathering license that requires similar or stricter licensing for rerelease.\n\nAll content is provided as-is to be used at your own risk of fun or otherwise.\n\nIf you have found this in a far flung future, the language used here is English, specifically an ancient snapshot known as \"Modern English\" as defined by certain pompous people of the time period between the years AD1990 to AD2021.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"KeepModReadme"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableSmartRefs":true},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"KeepModReadme","description":"Keep the Uber Mod For Quake"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://JosiahJack.github.io/","assetsPrefix":"/KeepModReadme","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
