Whenever an entity would have\ntouched it if it were solid, then it causes its <code>touch</code> function to run.  This\nis used to trigger events.  This could be as mundane as the typical target IO,\nperform a special action, or acting upon the entities that touched it.</p>\n<p>There is no real limit to what behavior a trigger can have or on who or what\ncan trigger it.  Different triggers are normally configured to be either player\nonly, monster only, projectile only, or some combination.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"extras-emitters\">Extras Emitters<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#extras-emitters\"></a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Attributions: Frank Condello (aka pOx), Khreathor for the extras_r5 update</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Specialty particles and emitters that react to physics, and their affectors.</p>\n<p>Particle systems with QuakeC - packet overflows made easy!\nThese were modeled after particle systems in high-end 3D apps, they are not\nthe most user friendly entities around...</p>\n<p>EMITTER ENTITIES: func_emitter, func_emitter_volume\nEFFECTOR TRIGGERS: t_effector_destroy, t_effector_push, t_effector_gravity,\nt_effector_trubulence, t_effector_attract, t_effector_friction</p>\n<p>Emitters generate a \"particle\" (either a .spr, .mdl or .bsp) and toss it in\na direction between the set angle limits.

Set KILLINFWATER to have them die in\nfunc_water volumes.</p>\n<p>ANGLES EXPLAINED:\nThe angle limits may take a while to get used to, but it's a really powerful\nway to control the direction and spread. Start by setting just v1 and h1 to\nget a tight stream in the general direction, then adjust v1/v2 and h1/h2 to\nwithin a few degrees (plus and minus) of the original value to increase the\nspread for a cone-shaped fountain. Ommit either h2 or v2 for a fan shaped\nemission, or set v1=1 v2=360 h1=1 h2=360 for a fire-works style spherical\nburst.</p>\n<p>The following diagram visualizes the horizontal and vertical angle relationship.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/KeepModReadme/assets/img/emitter_angles.gif\" alt=\"Emitter Angles\"></p>\n<p>When viewing a map from the top, an H angle value of 270 points up, and\nmoves clockwise, making right 360 (or 0), down 90 and left 180. Same goes\nfor the V angle when viewed from the front.</p>\n<p>The particle spread is always contained from the first angle (h1/v1) to the\nsecond angle (h2/v2), going clockwise. So h1=10 h2=350 is NOT the same as\nh1=350 h2=10. (the first is a near circular spread, while the second is a\ntight 20º fan shaped spread).</p>\n<p>Also note that although 0 would normally be a valid replacement for 360, you\nshould use a range of 1 - 360 as a value of 0 is simply ignored (though this\nmay be desirable in certain situations).</p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Children</strong>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"/KeepModReadme/notes/ldln4vkmzi2jnnqt2b6yhfj\">T_effector_attract</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/KeepModReadme/notes/1piidf7u8r1zd46bfmk365b\">T_effector_destroy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/KeepModReadme/notes/rytdif4qpgxmh3d05tfcca4\">T_effector_friction</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/KeepModReadme/notes/1s3kifz307c38ebzepns2ky\">T_effector_gravity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/KeepModReadme/notes/9rswvowqoowslmcyz9yup0q\">T_effector_push</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/KeepModReadme/notes/8m42wxmgu6xjsvh4r2iebqn\">T_effector_trubulence</a></li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/KeepModReadme/notes/ldln4vkmzi2jnnqt2b6yhfj\">T_effector_attract</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/KeepModReadme/notes/1piidf7u8r1zd46bfmk365b\">T_effector_destroy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/KeepModReadme/notes/rytdif4qpgxmh3d05tfcca4\">T_effector_friction</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","title":"TOME OF KEEP MOD","desc":"","updated":1682424325599,"created":1657642701590,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"KeepModReadme"},"contentHash":"4c52ea882ee2e021d34960efe1b0ae09","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"general","position":{"start":{"line":73,"column":3,"offset":4311},"end":{"line":73,"column":14,"offset":4322},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"general"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"credits","position":{"start":{"line":74,"column":3,"offset":4325},"end":{"line":74,"column":14,"offset":4336},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"credits"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"enemies","position":{"start":{"line":75,"column":3,"offset":4339},"end":{"line":75,"column":14,"offset":4350},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"enemies"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"weapons","position":{"start":{"line":76,"column":3,"offset":4353},"end":{"line":76,"column":14,"offset":4364},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"weapons"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"items","position":{"start":{"line":77,"column":3,"offset":4367},"end":{"line":77,"column":12,"offset":4376},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"items"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"traps","position":{"start":{"line":78,"column":3,"offset":4379},"end":{"line":78,"column":12,"offset":4388},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"traps"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"brush-entities","position":{"start":{"line":79,"column":3,"offset":4391},"end":{"line":79,"column":21,"offset":4409},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"brush-entities"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"point-entities","position":{"start":{"line":80,"column":3,"offset":4412},"end":{"line":80,"column":21,"offset":4430},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"point-entities"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"requirements","position":{"start":{"line":81,"column":3,"offset":4433},"end":{"line":81,"column":19,"offset":4449},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"requirements"}}],"anchors":{"current-version":{"type":"header","text":"Current Version:","value":"current-version","line":7,"column":0,"depth":4},"compiled-and-edited-by-w-josiah-jack-aka-qmaster--aug-23-2008-to-2024":{"type":"header","text":"Compiled and Edited by W.

Within these dusty pages you may find a detailed technical explanation of what I have discovered and kept on my many travels in the land of Quake.\n\nWhat started as an effort to add a few items from both mission packs into one single player level eventually grew over time to be a massive compilation of features from across the Quake community.\nThis mod for the first [Quake (1996)](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake) is primarily a full combination of the following mods’ enemies, weapons, items, traps, and other features in addition to\nmy own features:\n* Standard Quake (ID1)........[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake)]\n* Mission Pack 1 (Hipnotic)...[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake_Mission_Pack_1:_Scourge_of_Armagon)]\n* Mission Pack 2 (Rogue)......[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake_Mission_Pack_2:_Dissolution_of_Eternity)]\n* Arcane Dimensions (AD) [[link](http://www.simonoc.com/pages/design/sp/ad.htm)] [[mirror](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/ad_v1_80p1final.html)]\n* Drake (SOE, etc.) [[link](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/something_wicked.html)]\n* Quoth [[quoth 1](https://www.quaddicted.com/webarchive/kell.quaddicted.com/) [[quoth 2.2](https://tomeofpreach.wordpress.com/quoth/)]\n* Kinn (Marcher, etc.) [[marcher](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/kinn_marcher.html) [[bastion](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/kinn_bastion.html)]\n* Custents [[link](https://www.quakewiki.net/quake-1/mods/custents-custom-entities/)]\n* extras_r5 [[link](https://github.com/khreathor/extras_r5)] [[extras_r4 (older)](https://www.quakewiki.net/quake-1/mods/extras-r4/)] [[docs](http://khreathor.xyz/jam/extras/index.html)]\n* Nehahra [[link](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/nehahra.html)]\n* Rubicon and Rubicon 2 [[rubicon](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/rubicon.html)] [[rubicon2](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/rubicon2.html)] [[rrp](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/rrp.html)]\n* Other various community contributions, refer to the Credits\n\n\nArcane Dimensions serves as the primary base for all added content due to its excellent formatting, enhanced enemy infighting code, and excellent structure.\n\nAny conflicts have been resolved in such a manner as to retain the unique features of the primary mods above, for instance by using spawnflags, such that any mod's conflicting variant is avaialable.\nThe entity definition file (.fgd) contains all the necessary fields and spawnflags for accessing these conflict resolving features as well as any Keep specific features that have been added.\n\nAll features of this mod are documented here in their various sections.  A complete entity list can be found in the appendix.  In every section the entities are listed alphabetically by entity name.\n\nFor what is and isn't implemented, refer to the [Checklist](https://github.com/JosiahJack/Keep/blob/master/KeepFeatureChecklist.xlsx)\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe purpose of this mod is to provide a toolset for creating any kind of Quake\nmap you desire with anything you may have encountered in some of the best known\nmods.  This mod is a mod for mappers, intended for mappers to make excellent\nmaps for players to play.  Also, in the spirit of the earliest days of Quake,\nthis mod is not striving for overall quality, nor quantity, but is intending to\nprovide fun.  Some content is intentionally as-is, in terms of quality, to\npreserve the old-school 90's feel; other content is much more polished.  The\nquality of content you use is up to you, the mapper.\n\n> The mapper is always right.  The player is at the mercy of the mapper.\n\n# TABLE OF CONTENTS\nHere are links to each book within the tome.\n\n* [[general]]\n* [[credits]]\n* [[enemies]]\n* [[weapons]]\n* [[items]]\n* [[traps]]\n* [[brush-entities]]\n* [[point-entities]]\n* [[requirements]]\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nDISCLAIMERS:\nThe contents herein may have originally derived from other authors.
