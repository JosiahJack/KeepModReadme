# Chain Lightning Gun

#### `weapon_chain_lightning`

### Normal Effects
Fires large shaft of lightning that splits between nearby enemies, damaging
all at once, but uses cells very rapidly.  Discharging in the water drains all
cells and causes damage in a 35 * cells radius with 35 * cells damage.
Also pierces anything in its path along the shaft. Damage is applied every
0.1s.

### Tome of Power Effects
Increased damage plus spark effects at impact.
