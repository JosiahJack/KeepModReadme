<h1 id="shrines">Shrines<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#shrines"></a></h1>
<p>The inhabitants of the world of Quake are not altogether unreligious.  There is a plenary collection of deities and household teraphim.  Travelers may choose to pay their respects by lighting a candle and thus receive a blessing.  It is important to distinguish between <em>teraphim</em>, who serve as physical representatives of deities and <em>idols</em>, who are treated as deities of themselves.  However, one may alternatively disregard such lesser deities and distinctions entirely and pay respects to a higher deity by counting these shrines as unholy, desecrating them by smashing them to receive an alternative blessing from an elder god.  What one does must be considered carefully, even atheistically ignoring shrines may have consequences.</p>
<h3 id="benefits">Benefits<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#benefits"></a></h3>
<p>These are the shrine benefits.  Detailed per <code>style</code> benefits given in the chart further down.</p>
<p><strong>Respects</strong> are paid simply by walking up to a shrine's table structure.  The candle(s) will be lit by trigger.</p>
<p><strong>Desecration</strong> is performed by destroying the shrine table.  Desecration after Respects will remove the respect blessing and may possibly be met with even stronger consequences.  Desecration affects all players in coop.</p>
<p>Blessings are only granted for that level.</p>
<h3 id="construction-standards">Construction Standards<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#construction-standards"></a></h3>
<p>All shrines must have at least one candle placed mostly centered on a 32 high table structure with a thin <code>trigger_once</code> that is sized 8x32x32, with the trigger thinnest at the table front, touching the table, trigger top surface flush with tabletop, and trigger centered with the table.  The candle should start off by setting <code>spawnflags</code> 1 and giving a <code>targetname</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>trigger_once</code> must target an <code>info_shrine</code> with a <code>style</code> type set, while the table shall be a <code>func_breakable</code> that targets the same <code>info_shrine</code>.  When an <code>info_shrine</code> is targeted, it checks if the target is a player for Respects, or a breakable for Desecration.</p>
<p>Shrine theming should be consistent with the guide in the chart below; arrangement, details, and shape at mapper discretion.  Use of a shrine prefabs as-is is fine, though <code>message</code> should be changed to suit your map's story.</p>
<p><code>info_shrine</code> should be placed above the table, ideally in a place that makes sense as a point from which aura effects emanate.  This is the center of the aura, so place accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="story-elements">Story Elements<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#story-elements"></a></h3>
<p>Shrines have a god associated with them that a mapper specifies with <code>message</code>.  Associated <code>&#x3C;blessing></code> is in the chart below with a different blessing message for when a shrine is respected or desecrated.
When blessed, the centerprint displayed will display a message like so:</p>
<pre><code>&#x3C;god>
of the &#x3C;style> Shrine has blessed
you with &#x3C;blessing> 
</code></pre>
<p>Or</p>
<pre><code>&#x3C;god>
of the &#x3C;style> Shrine has lost influence,
the Elder God blesses with
&#x3C;blessing> 
</code></pre>
<h3 id="aura">Aura<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#aura"></a></h3>
<p>Auras apply the effects in the chart below to any players within the aura.  The aura effects are applied once every <code>delay</code> seconds for an amount of <code>cnt</code>.  Any monsters who are not of EVIL <code>alignment</code> will always receive healing at the same rate as the <code>delay</code> and <code>cnt</code> and also receive an increase in their pain timer to 5 seconds past the current time, so they won't go into any pain flinch animations while within the aura and can continue to consistently help players.  Monster benefits are the same regardless of <code>style</code>.</p>
<h3 id="blessings">Blessings<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#blessings"></a></h3>
<p>Blessings are always the same according to below, but the response to actions is map specific based on the <code>target</code> set on the <code>info_shrine</code>.  Best practice is for desecration to target delay spawned monsters who have <code>nomonstercount</code> of 1 so that shrines who aren't desecrated still show all monsters have been killed.</p>
