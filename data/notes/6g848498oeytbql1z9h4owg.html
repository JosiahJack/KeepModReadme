<blockquote>
<p>Moving water volumes - honest and for true.  --extras_r4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A brush entity that behaves like normal water.  Has capability of acting like a
func_door and draining or flooding an area with complete swimmability and any
liquid effects if it is slime or lava.</p>
<p>Capable of having a current.  If brush is very shallow, may need spawnflag 16
or the current will be too weak.  Set current by using <code>mangle</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"An easy way to make rising/falling water, but
<a href="/KeepModReadme/notes/u4blexnxlrmt9mpordkm4g7">Func_watertrain</a> is much more flexible (it can do anything
func_water can do, and then some, but it's more work to setup)"</p>

<h3 id="method-1">METHOD 1:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#method-1"></a></h3>
<p>Use a custom QBSP util with func_water support (this does NOT require an
engine mod). Just use ericw's <a href="https://ericwa.github.io/ericw-tools/">qbsp</a>
with _mirrorinside 1.</p>
<p>eQBSP v1.0b for MacOS supports this - <a href="http://quake.chaoticbox.com/downloads/equakeutils.sit">eQuake Utils (852kb, MacOS 9 &#x26; MacOS X (PPC) compatible)</a>.  </p>
<h3 id="method-2-hackaround">METHOD 2 (hackaround):<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#method-2-hackaround"></a></h3>
<p>Add thin (1 unit) brushes for visible edges, but make sure these brushes
DON'T touch the main volume (1 unit away), or the face will be consumed by
QBSP!  You can disable mirroring in eQBSP per-entity by setting
the "_nomirror" key to a non-zero value, and use "METHOD 2" to backface the
problem brush.  Skip textured surfaces may help in some cases.  Older compilers
may need *waterskip.  This whole method of course assumes it doesn't move,
though so usually just use method 1 and ericw's
<a href="https://ericwa.github.io/ericw-tools/">compilers</a>.</p>
<h3 id="other-notes">Other Notes<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#other-notes"></a></h3>
<p>Avoid butting func_water surfaces right up against solid geometry or you'll get
z-fighting artifacts where real water wouldn't (extend "hidden" edges into a
solid wall).</p>
<p>Unavoidable differences between func_water and real water:</p>
<ol>
<li>Underwater surfaces don't warp</li>
<li>Surface is always opaque</li>
</ol>
