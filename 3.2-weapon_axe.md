#### `weapon_axe`

### Normal Effects
Weakest weapon. Simple axe with a few different swing angles. Possible to
change visual appearance from ID1 axe model to AD axe by setting `useold_axe`
to 1 in worldspawn. The AD axe will better match the shadow axe upgrade. See
the [Shadow Axe](3. Guarantees that enemies who have longer pain animations
will always go into the longer animations enabling higher chance of player to
land more hits; this aids in axe only map starts.

### Tome of Power Effects
Double damage and guarateed to gib zombies standing or laying. This is more
than simply upgrading to the shadow axe's behavior.
