Within these dusty pages you may find a detailed technical explanation of what I have discovered and kept on my many travels in the land of Quake.\n\nWhat started as an effort to add a few items from both mission packs into one single player level eventually grew over time to be a massive compilation of features from across the Quake community.\nThis mod for the first [Quake (1996)](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake) is primarily a full combination of the following modsâ€™ enemies, weapons, items, traps, and other features in addition to\nmy own features:\n* Standard Quake (ID1)........[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake)]\n* Mission Pack 1 (Hipnotic)...[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake_Mission_Pack_1:_Scourge_of_Armagon)]\n* Mission Pack 2 (Rogue)......[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake_Mission_Pack_2:_Dissolution_of_Eternity)]\n* Arcane Dimensions (AD) [[link](http://www.simonoc.com/pages/design/sp/ad.htm)] [[mirror](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/ad_v1_80p1final.html)]\n* Drake (SOE, etc.) [[link](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/something_wicked.html)]\n* Quoth [[quoth 1](https://www.quaddicted.com/webarchive/kell.quaddicted.com/) [[quoth 2.2](https://tomeofpreach.wordpress.com/quoth/)]\n* Kinn (Marcher, etc.) [[marcher](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/kinn_marcher.html) [[bastion](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/kinn_bastion.html)]\n* Custents [[link](https://www.quakewiki.net/quake-1/mods/custents-custom-entities/)]\n* extras_r5 [[link](https://github.com/khreathor/extras_r5)] [[extras_r4 (older)](https://www.quakewiki.net/quake-1/mods/extras-r4/)] [[docs](http://khreathor.xyz/jam/extras/index.html)]\n* Nehahra [[link](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/nehahra.html)]\n* Rubicon and Rubicon 2 [[rubicon](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/rubicon.html)] [[rubicon2](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/rubicon2.html)] [[rrp](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/rrp.html)]\n* Other various community contributions, refer to the Credits\n\n\nArcane Dimensions serves as the primary base for all added content due to its excellent formatting, enhanced enemy infighting code, and excellent structure.\n\nAny conflicts have been resolved in such a manner as to retain the unique features of the primary mods above, for instance by using spawnflags, such that any mod's conflicting variant is avaialable.\nThe entity definition file (.fgd) contains all the necessary fields and spawnflags for accessing these conflict resolving features as well as any Keep specific features that have been added.\n\nAll features of this mod are documented here in their various sections.  A complete entity list can be found in the appendix.  In every section the entities are listed alphabetically by entity name.\n\nFor what is and isn't implemented, refer to the [Checklist](https://github.com/JosiahJack/Keep/blob/master/KeepFeatureChecklist.xlsx)\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe purpose of this mod is to provide a toolset for creating any kind of Quake\nmap you desire with anything you may have encountered in some of the best known\nmods.  This mod is a mod for mappers, intended for mappers to make excellent\nmaps for players to play.  Also, in the spirit of the earliest days of Quake,\nthis mod is not striving for overall quality, nor quantity, but is intending to\nprovide fun.  Some content is intentionally as-is, in terms of quality, to\npreserve the old-school 90's feel; other content is much more polished.  The\nquality of content you use is up to you, the mapper.\n\n> The mapper is always right.  The player is at the mercy of the mapper.\n\n# TABLE OF CONTENTS\nHere are links to each book within the tome.\n\n* [[general]]\n* [[credits]]\n* [[enemies]]\n* [[weapons]]\n* [[items]]\n* [[traps]]\n* [[brush-entities]]\n* [[point-entities]]\n* [[requirements]]\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nDISCLAIMERS:\nThe contents herein may have originally derived from other authors.  I make no claim that the full contents are an original work, rather only the compilation as such is original.  Please refer to the\nSource Mod specified on each item's listing and refer to the credits folder for the original authors of some content.  Most content is GPL licensed since original Quake qc code and engine were\nrelease under said grandfathering license that requires similar or stricter licensing for rerelease.\n\nAll content is provided as-is to be used at your own risk of fun or otherwise.\n\nIf you have found this in a far flung future, the language used here is English, specifically an ancient snapshot known as \"Modern English\" as defined by certain pompous people of the time period between the years AD1990 to AD2021.\n","n":0.041}}},{"i":2,"$":{"0":{"v":"Weapons","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nThere are numerous weapons available.  Below is a chart listing each weapon\r\nwith its stats.  The impulse value given below is the internal number used by\r\nthe code to switch to that weapon; this can be used via the console by entering\r\n`impulse ###` console command and replacing \\### with the desired number from\r\nbelow to switch directly to that weapon without the need for pressing a slot's\r\nkeyboard key multiple times.  Also possible to add new keybinds for specific\r\nweapons by adding `\"bind\" \"keyhere\" \"impulse ###\"` in your config.cfg file and\r\nchanging \"keyhere\" to desired keyboard key.  The weapon has to have been picked\r\nup first.\r\n\r\nFurther down is a chart listing the keyboard key defaults for each weapon 'slot'\r\nand the weapons in that slot.  Pressing the keyboard key will first switch to\r\nthe first weapon in the slot that the player has in inventory; further presses\r\nof the same key will cycle through the weapons in the slot.\r\n\r\n### Overrides\r\n\r\nSome weapons are _override_ weapons.  An override will fully replace a weapon\r\nin its slot, for instance the Shadow Axe replaces the standard Axe.  The\r\nfollowing overrides are not given by CheatCommand since they don't always apply\r\nto every map (refer to [Cheat Codes](8.5-Cheat-Codes.md) for more info):\r\n* [[weapons.weapon_blaster]]\r\n* [[weapons.weapon_chainsaw]]\r\n* [MIRV Launcher]\r\n* [Plasma Gun]\r\n* [Chaingun]\r\n* [Riot Controller]\r\n* [Quad Shotgun]\r\n\r\nNOTE: The [Widowmaker](3.33-weapon_upgrade_ssg.md) _is_ given since it is too\r\nawesome not to and suits any theme.\r\n\r\n## Weapons Table\r\n\r\n|Name______________________|Entity_________________________|Source Mod_____|Damage_______________________________________________________|Description_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________|Ammo (Uses 1 Unless Specified)_______________|Impulse|Tome_of_Power_Effects___________________________________________________________________________________________|\r\n|:-------------------------|:------------------------------|:--------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|:------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|                                                                                                                                   \r\n|Blood Mace                |weapon_mace                    |AoA            |45                                                           |Each hit recovers 5 HP.

These are useful in many situations and allow for a large amount of flexibility in setups and creating special events, large and small.\r\n\r\n# General Logic Entities\r\n\r\n### `info_player_start`\r\nStarting point for the player in single player games.  Also used as one of the spawn points for coop.  Placing more than one will create a warning, should only ever be 1, which is why we have...\r\n\r\n### `info_player_startdev`\r\nForced to use and only used as starting point if `developer` is 1.  Useful for immediately starting in area of the map for testing without having to noclip over there.\r\n\r\n### `info_player_coop`\r\nStarting point for coop players.  Coop players will start here first, if present, before picking the `info_player_start` instead.  `spawnflags` 64 will cause this to start off.  Can be enabled or disabled using the entity state system (see below).\r\n\r\n### `info_player_start2`\r\nSecondary starting point for the player in single player games.  Player will spawn here if serverflag bitmask value 16, 32, or 64 is true or if player had all 4 runes in previous map.\r\n\r\n### `info_player_coop2`\r\nSecondary starting point for the player in coop games.  Player will spawn here if serverflag bitmask value 16, 32, or 64 is true or if player had all 4 runes in previous map.  Coop players will start here first, if present and met the above conditions, before picking the `info_player_start2` instead.  `spawnflags` 64 will cause this to start off.  Can be enabled or disabled using the entity state system (see below).\r\n\r\n\r\n### `info_player_deathmatch `\r\nSecondary starting point for the player in deathmatch games.  You should sprinkle at least 4 of these around every level.  `spawnflags` 64 will cause this to start off.  Can be enabled or disabled using the entity state system (see below).\r\n\r\n### `info_skyroom`\r\nSkyroom camera for QSS/FTE engines for implementation of 3D skyboxes.  Automatically sets worldspawn's `_skyroom` value to the origin vector of the location of this entity.  Overrides worldspawn.  Only 1 should be used.  If using multiple, the last one placed in the map editor will be used.\r\n\r\n### `info_intermission `\r\nThis is used to display a view of the level after completing it.  Typically shows off one of the best viewing angles of an area of the map.  Best if used to showcase memorable setpieces.  Can be and highly recommended to be more than one.  Clicking the mouse switches to the next camera.  Pressing jump will exit the level.\r\n|Key|Type|Default|Description|\r\n|---|---|---|---|\r\n|target|string||Used to trigger actions upon first switching to this intermission camera.

Overlord will teleport to a random one of these points.  Set multiple if desired.\r\n\r\n### `info_morph_destination`\r\nUsed by `monster_morph` to teleport to when randomly teleporting away.  Guardian will teleport to a random one of these points.  Set multiple if desired.\r\n\r\n### `info_target`\r\nUseful to set a position for an object to move towards, such as a door or button.\r\n\r\n### `info_home`\r\nUseful to set a starting position for a `func_qrobot`.\r\n\r\n### `info_null`\r\nUseful to set a spotlight target.  Removed on game start.\r\n\r\n### `info_notnull`\r\nDoes nothing...but can!

This makes this `info_command`'s message not execute until another `info_command` is triggered that does not have this spawnflag set.|\r\n\r\n### `info_command_server`\r\nSame as `info_command` but gets sent to all players and not just the current player on this PC.  Useful for coop or deathmatch.\r\n|Key|Type|Default|Description|\r\n|---|---|---|---|\r\n|targetname|string||Name of this entity.  Required.|\r\n|message|string||This is the actual command to pass to the console.

Set to -1 for only once, but needs `targetname` set for triggering if so.|\r\n\r\n### `trigger_relay`\r\n\r\n# Entity State System\r\nWhen the Arcane Dimensions mod came out, it introduced a novel idea for handling the enabling and disabling of various entities, including triggers.  Quoting its description here:\r\n\r\n`When Quake first came out there were strict limitations on how many entities\r\ncould exist and be active at the same time. The quick fix solution to this\r\nproblem was to use the ``killtarget`` key so that entities could be removed. \r\nThis was a very powerful feature with very few restrictions on what it \r\ncould affect or destroy at the same time.`\r\n\r\n`The idea of the entity state system is to create a way to safely switch\r\nentities on, off or have then temporarily disabled. This will help prevent\r\nsituations where entity chains are broken or strange errors occur because\r\nthe touch function does not have an entity anymore.`\r\n\r\n`The entity state is a new key on entities which is designed to work in a\r\npassive mode until it is activated. All the entities listed below have a\r\ndefault value so that any existing map will still work as before.`\r\n\r\n`There are two methods for changing the entity state and the first method\r\nis an extra key on ``trigger`` entities (_once, _multi, _relay etc)`\r\n  \r\n`The second method is via a brand new set of entities which can affect \r\nmultiple targets at once and are much easier (visually) to see what is\r\ngoing on because most editors draw target lines.`\r\n\r\n## Entity State Information Table\r\n|Estate Action|Estate Condition Result|Description of Action|Description of State|\r\n|---|---|---|---|\r\n|Disable|DISABLED|Puts entity into DISABLED state.|Blocks any targeted ability or entity functionality and turns off any visual aids like animated textures.|\r\n|Turn Off|OFF|Puts into OFF state|Block all of the designed functionality and hide the entity entirely from interaction with the player.|\r\n|Enable|ON|Puts into ON state|(Default) Allows the entity to work as designed, be targeted and physically exist as per its setup|","n":0.026}}},{"i":276,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light_tubelight","n":1}}},{"i":277,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light_torch_small_walltorch","n":1}}},{"i":278,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light_torch_long_walltorch","n":1}}},{"i":279,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light_postlight","n":1}}},{"i":280,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light_lantern2","n":1}}},{"i":281,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light_lantern","n":1}}},{"i":282,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light_globecolor","n":1}}},{"i":283,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light_globe","n":1}}},{"i":284,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light_fluorospark","n":1}}},{"i":285,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light_fluoropost","n":1}}},{"i":286,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light_fluoro","n":1}}},{"i":287,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light_flame_small_yellow","n":1}}},{"i":288,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light_flame_small_white","n":1}}},{"i":289,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light_flame_pyre","n":1}}},{"i":290,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light_flame_large_yellow","n":1}}},{"i":291,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light_flame_brazier_tall","n":1}}},{"i":292,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light_flame_brazier_short","n":1}}},{"i":293,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light_fixture1","n":1}}},{"i":294,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light_fix","n":1}}},{"i":295,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light_ceil","n":1}}},{"i":296,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light_candle","n":1}}},{"i":297,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light_beacon","n":1}}},{"i":298,"$":{"0":{"v":"Light","n":1}}},{"i":299,"$":{"0":{"v":"Item_zerlogo","n":1}}},{"i":300,"$":{"0":{"v":"Item_tree","n":1}}},{"i":301,"$":{"0":{"v":"Item_treasure_gem","n":1}}},{"i":302,"$":{"0":{"v":"Item_treasure_coin","n":1}}},{"i":303,"$":{"0":{"v":"Item_time_machine","n":1}}},{"i":304,"$":{"0":{"v":"Item_time_core","n":1}}},{"i":305,"$":{"0":{"v":"Item_taunt","n":1}}},{"i":306,"$":{"0":{"v":"Item_secrethunter","n":1}}},{"i":307,"$":{"0":{"v":"Item_pushup","n":1}}},{"i":308,"$":{"0":{"v":"Item_flashlight","n":1}}},{"i":309,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_teleportinstant_dest","n":1}}},{"i":310,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_teleport_destination","n":1}}},{"i":311,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_target","n":1}}},{"i":312,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_startendtext","n":1}}},{"i":313,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_sprite_static","n":1}}},{"i":314,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_spirit_destination","n":1}}},{"i":315,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_skyroom","n":1}}},{"i":316,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_skullwiz_destination","n":1}}},{"i":317,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_shrine","n":1}}},{"i":318,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_script","n":1}}},{"i":319,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_screenshake","n":1}}},{"i":320,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_rotate","n":1}}},{"i":321,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_player_team2","n":1}}},{"i":322,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_player_team1","n":1}}},{"i":323,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_player_startdev","n":1}}},{"i":324,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_player_start2","n":1}}},{"i":325,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_player_start","n":1}}},{"i":326,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_player_deathmatch","n":1}}},{"i":327,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_player_coop2","n":1}}},{"i":328,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_player_coop","n":1}}},{"i":329,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_overlord_destination","n":1}}},{"i":330,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_null","n":1}}},{"i":331,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_notnull","n":1}}},{"i":332,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_movie_camera","n":1}}},{"i":333,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_morph_destination","n":1}}},{"i":334,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_intermission","n":1}}},{"i":335,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_home","n":1}}},{"i":336,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_givepower","n":1}}},{"i":337,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_focal_point","n":1}}},{"i":338,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_filter","n":1}}},{"i":339,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_effect_pulse","n":1}}},{"i":340,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_earthquake","n":1}}},{"i":341,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_command_spawn","n":1}}},{"i":342,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_command_server","n":1}}},{"i":343,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_command","n":1}}},{"i":344,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_camera_destination","n":1}}},{"i":345,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_boss_spot","n":1}}},{"i":346,"$":{"0":{"v":"Info_bomb","n":1}}},{"i":347,"$":{"0":{"v":"Func_watertrain","n":1}}},{"i":348,"$":{"0":{"v":"Func_water","n":1},"1":{"v":">Moving water volumes - honest and for true.  --extras_r4\n\nA brush entity that behaves like normal water.

Just use ericw's [qbsp](https://ericwa.github.io/ericw-tools/)\nwith _mirrorinside 1.\n\neQBSP v1.0b for MacOS supports this - [eQuake Utils (852kb, MacOS 9 & MacOS X (PPC) compatible)](http://quake.chaoticbox.com/downloads/equakeutils.sit).  \n\n### METHOD 2 (hackaround):\nAdd thin (1 unit) brushes for visible edges, but make sure these brushes\nDON'T touch the main volume (1 unit away), or the face will be consumed by\nQBSP!  You can disable mirroring in eQBSP per-entity by setting\nthe \"_nomirror\" key to a non-zero value, and use \"METHOD 2\" to backface the\nproblem brush.  Skip textured surfaces may help in some cases.  Older compilers\nmay need *waterskip.  This whole method of course assumes it doesn't move,\nthough so usually just use method 1 and ericw's\n[compilers](https://ericwa.github.io/ericw-tools/).\n\n### Other Notes\nAvoid butting func_water surfaces right up against solid geometry or you'll get\nz-fighting artifacts where real water wouldn't (extend \"hidden\" edges into a\nsolid wall).\n\nUnavoidable differences between func_water and real water:\n1. Underwater surfaces don't warp\n2.

Most of them are the same and simply change the default sound file that is played.  Alternatively, `ambient_custom_looping` can be used in place of any of these so long as you know what sound file to specify.\r\n\r\nSome sounds are looping, others are non-looped sounds played via trigger.  Some ambients play non-looped sounds that get played at randomized intervals.  Certain specialized ambients will play multiple different randomly picked non-looped sounds at randomized intervals; these are typically named `ambient_custom_` at the beginning of their name, such as `ambient_custom_wind` or `ambient_custom_wood`.  These features are extremely popular and have many different various implementations in almost all mods.\r\n\r\n# Standard Ambient Noises\r\nThese are simply static location, looping sound effects that play the same sound file over and over indefinitely.

There is a plenary collection of deities and household teraphim.  Travelers may choose to pay their respects by lighting a candle and thus receive a blessing.  It is important to distinguish between _teraphim_, who serve as physical representatives of deities and _idols_, who are treated as deities of themselves.  However, one may alternatively disregard such lesser deities and distinctions entirely and pay respects to a higher deity by counting these shrines as unholy, desecrating them by smashing them to receive an alternative blessing from an elder god.  What one does must be considered carefully, even atheistically ignoring shrines may have consequences.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\nThese are the shrine benefits.  Detailed per `style` benefits given in the chart further down.\r\n\r\n**Respects** are paid simply by walking up to a shrine's table structure.  The candle(s) will be lit by trigger.\r\n\r\n**Desecration** is performed by destroying the shrine table.  Desecration after Respects will remove the respect blessing and may possibly be met with even stronger consequences.  Desecration affects all players in coop.\r\n\r\nBlessings are only granted for that level.\r\n\r\n### Construction Standards\r\nAll shrines must have at least one candle placed mostly centered on a 32 high table structure with a thin `trigger_once` that is sized 8x32x32, with the trigger thinnest at the table front, touching the table, trigger top surface flush with tabletop, and trigger centered with the table.  The candle should start off by setting `spawnflags` 1 and giving a `targetname`.\r\n\r\nThe `trigger_once` must target an `info_shrine` with a `style` type set, while the table shall be a `func_breakable` that targets the same `info_shrine`.  When an `info_shrine` is targeted, it checks if the target is a player for Respects, or a breakable for Desecration.\r\n\r\nShrine theming should be consistent with the guide in the chart below; arrangement, details, and shape at mapper discretion.  Use of a shrine prefabs as-is is fine, though `message` should be changed to suit your map's story.\r\n\r\n`info_shrine` should be placed above the table, ideally in a place that makes sense as a point from which aura effects emanate.  This is the center of the aura, so place accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Story Elements\r\nShrines have a god associated with them that a mapper specifies with `message`.  Associated `<blessing>` is in the chart below with a different blessing message for when a shrine is respected or desecrated. \r\nWhen blessed, the centerprint displayed will display a message like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<god>\r\nof the <style> Shrine has blessed\r\nyou with <blessing> \r\n```\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\n```\r\n<god>\r\nof the <style> Shrine has lost influence,\r\nthe Elder God blesses with\r\n<blessing> \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Aura\r\nAuras apply the effects in the chart below to any players within the aura.  The aura effects are applied once every `delay` seconds for an amount of `cnt`.  Any monsters who are not of EVIL `alignment` will always receive healing at the same rate as the `delay` and `cnt` and also receive an increase in their pain timer to 5 seconds past the current time, so they won't go into any pain flinch animations while within the aura and can continue to consistently help players.  Monster benefits are the same regardless of `style`.\r\n\r\n### Blessings\r\nBlessings are always the same according to below, but the response to actions is map specific based on the `target` set on the `info_shrine`.  Best practice is for desecration to target delay spawned monsters who have `nomonstercount` of 1 so that shrines who aren't desecrated still show all monsters have been killed.\r\n\r\n|Shrine Type|`style`|Rune Sign|Respect Blessing|Desecration Blessing|Theme Requirements|Recommended Decorations|\r\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\r\n|Earth|0|Green|\"Aura of Earth Magick,\\nbecome as stone.\" Grants aura that rapidly provides armor to nearby players and player followers and removes poison buffs, 1 armor per every 0.3 secs.

Specified as a vector like `0 0 0 0` (d r g b for density red green blue).  If you plan to use `trigger_fog`, you must also set `fog_density` and `fog_colour` values below for the trigger to be able to transition between fog values properly.\r\n> * d = fog density 0 to 1.0.  Low values work best for larger view distances. 1.0 will make it hard to see anything past the player's nose.  Recommend 0.02.\r\n> * r = red value 0 to 1.0\r\n> * g = green value 0 to 1.0\r\n> * b = blue value 0 to 1.0\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Default to `0 0 0 0`, no density, no fog.\r\n\r\n### `fog_density`\r\n* **Type:** float\r\n* **If Set:** Changes the fog density 0 to 1.0.  Low values below 0.10 work best.  This should match the fog density paramater in `fog` to work properly with `trigger_fog` changes.\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Default to 0, no fog.\r\n\r\n### `fog_colour`\r\n* **Type:** vector\r\n* **If Set:** Changes the fog color.  Specified as a vector like `0 0 0` (r g b for red green blue).  This should match the fog density paramater in `fog` to work properly with `trigger_fog` changes.\r\n> * r = red value 0 to 1.0\r\n> * g = green value 0 to 1.0\r\n> * b = blue value 0 to 1.0\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Default to `0 0 0`, black.\r\n\r\n### `fog_dpextra`\r\n* **Type:** vector4\r\n* **If Set:** Changes the specialty fog settings used by the DarkPlaces engine.  Specified as a vector like `0 0 0 0` (a s e h f for alpha start end height fadedepth).  These get added to the full `fog` command after `d r g b` like so: `d r g b a s e h f`.  Most engines will ignore these values.\r\n> * a = alpha, modifies overall transparency of the fog (best to leave this at 1 and modify density instead)\r\n> * s = start, changes the start radius distance from the player camera before fog starts to increase in density from 0 to `density`.\r\n> * e = end, radius distance from the player camera before fog is full `density`.  Density will taper linearly in between s and e.\r\n> * h = height, height below which fog will work normally and above which fog is not present.\r\n> * f = fadedepth, the distance below height before fog transitions into normal effect.  Tapers linearly from no fog to normal fog in between.\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Default to `1 0 8192 1024 32`, no alpha adjustment, start at player camera center, 8192 distance from player for full fog `density`, 1024 height above world `0 0 0` for fog to start - above which density is always 0, and 32 for depth into the fog to transition to normal density (i.e. 1024 - 32 = 992 and below for fog to behave fully normally, above 1024 fog is gone, transitions in between)\r\n\r\n### `skyfog_density`\r\n* **Type:** float\r\n* **If Set:** Changes the starting `_skyfog` value for `trigger_skyfog`.  Set to match `_skyfog`.\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Default to 0.5.  Overrides `_skyfog` if greater than 0! Value linearly transitions from `_skyfog` to the this value as an inbetween and then to the new density specified on the trigger.\r\n\r\n### `_skyfog`\r\n* **Type:** float\r\n* **If Set:** Changes the fog color overlay on the skybox or sky textures only, 0 to 1.0.  1.0 causes sky to be **only** the color of the fog.\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Default to 0, fog does not change the appearance of the sky or skybox.  This gets overriden by `skyfog_density`!  Set to match!\r\n\r\n### `water_alpha`\r\n* **Type:** float\r\n* **If Set:** Changes the transparency of all normal *water brushes (texture names that start with `*`), 0 to 1.0.  1.0 is classic ID1 non-transparent water.

Please refer to [ericw Light](https://ericwa.github.io/ericw-tools/doc/light.html) for more details and up-to-date compiler documentation.\r\n\r\n### General Lighting\r\n### `_minlight`\r\n* **Type:** float (0 to 255)\r\n* **If Set:** Specifies the minimum overall light value to apply to **all** surfaces in the level.  255 is fully lit same as if you entered `r_fullbright 1` in the console.  Removes all deep dark shadows and pure black areas.  Use with caution.\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Defaults to 0, if there is no light entity placed near a surface, the surface will be pure black and provide maximum contrast.\r\n\r\n### `_minlight_color`\r\n* **Type:** vector (0 to 255)\r\n* **If Set:** Specifies the color for the minimum overall light value that is applied to **all** surfaces in the level.  Specified as 3 values like `0 0 0` (r g b for red green blue).  Useful for tinting the entire level to a certain color. `_minlight` must be greater than 0 to take any effect.  Removes all deep dark shadows and pure black areas.  Dramatically changes the colors of the level.  Use with caution.  Subtle colors tend towards better results and aesthetic. \r\n* **If Left Blank:** Defaults to `255 255 255` for normal white colored light.\r\n\r\n### `_minlight_dirt`\r\n* **Type:** trilean (-1, 0, or 1)\r\n* **If Set:** Affects dirtmapping for `_minlight`.  `_minlight` must be greater than 0 to take any effect.\r\n> * Set to -1 to disable and override all `_minlight_dirt` settings on individual brush entities.  Disables **all** dirt from `_minlight`.\r\n> * Set to 0 to use default of no dirt for the world and specific dirt for brush entities as specified individually by `_minlight_dirt` on each brush entity, if specified.\r\n> * Set to 1 to enable and use dirt mapping on **all** world surfaces.\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Defaults to 0.\r\n\r\n### `_range`\r\n* **Type:** float\r\n* **If Set:** Multiplies all lights' brightness (`light`) to scale the brightness for each light entity up or down.  Set to less than 0.5 for reduced brightness (darker) and to more than 0.5 for increased brightness (brighter).  Does not affect distance so may look odd if set too high.  Affects **all** lights.  Use with caution!\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Defaults to 0.5 (normal).\r\n\r\n### `_dist`\r\n* **Type:** float\r\n* **If Set:** Multiplies all lights' distance to scale the distance light will travel from each light entity up or down (behaves similar to `wait`).  Set to less than 1 for reduced distance (darker) and to more than 1 for increased distance (brighter).  Affects **all** lights.  Use with caution!\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Defaults to 1.0 (normal).\r\n\r\n### `_gamma`\r\n* **Type:** float\r\n* **If Set:** Multiplies all the full lightmap's brightness by this value.  Greater than 1 will increase the overall map brightness, less than 1 will reduce overall brightness.  Use with caution!\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Defaults to 1.0 (normal).\r\n\r\n### `_spotlightautofalloff`\r\n* **Type:** float\r\n* **If Set:** Changes default spotlight falloff distance to instead use the distance from the light to a targeted `info_null` (or other entity)'s center.  This only affects lights whose `_falloff` override is left blank (set to 0).  Light must have a `target`.\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Defaults to 0.  Light will use default spotlight settings to generate a spotlight when a light has a `target`.\r\n\r\n### `_dirt`\r\n* **Type:** trilean (-1, 0, or 1)\r\n* **If Set:** Affects dirtmapping for all surfaces.  Dirt adds less brightness along edges between faces depending on how acute the angle is between the face normals.  You can override the global setting for specific lights with the `_dirt` key, for point light entities, and the `_sunlight_dirt`, `_sunlight2_dirt`, `_minlight_dirt` keys, in `worldspawn`.\r\n> * Set to -1 to disable dirtmapping globally, including disabling entity dirt overrides.\r\n> * Set to 0 to use default value specified by `_dirt` on entities, but otherwise not use dirtmapping.\r\n> * Set to 1 to enable and use dirtmapping on all surfaces affected by lights except on brush entities or lights that disable it.\r\n\r\n### `_dirtmode`\r\n* **Type:** boolean (0 or 1)\r\n* **If Set:** Randomized dirtmapping.  Sometimes darkness (dirt) will not be applied to an edge. `_dirt` must be enabled.\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Normal dirtmapping.  `_dirt` must be enabled.\r\n\r\n### `_dirtscale`\r\n* **Type:** float\r\n* **If Set:** Scale the darkness of dirt.  Lower values reduce the dirt darkness while larger values make dirt shadowing darker and more noticeable.\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Defaults to 1.0\r\n\r\n### `_dirtgain`\r\n* **Type:** float\r\n* **If Set:** Modifies the exponental falloff for dirt attenuation.  Low values make shadows darker and stretch further from edges/corners.  High values make dirt taper off faster and therefore be less dark and go shorter distance from edges/corners.\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Defaults to 1.0\r\n\r\n### `_dirtdepth`\r\n* **Type:** float\r\n* **If Set:** Maximum depth in units for checking for and applying dirtmapping.\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Defaults to 128\r\n\r\n### `_dirtangle`\r\n* **Type:** float\r\n* **If Set:** Cone angle in degree for occlusion testing, 1 to 90.  Lower values might help remove unwanted dirt on the inside of arches, pipes, etc.\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Defaults to 88.\r\n\r\n### `_bounce`\r\n* **Type:** boolean (0 or 1)\r\n* **If Set:** Enables bounce lighting.  This adds extra light by using world surfaces as light sources to \"bounce\" more light from based on their brightness value from normal lighting.  Useful for softer shadows, no need for extra `light` entities, and more realistic lighting behavior (aka simulates global illumination, true global illumination uses color from the surfaces, see `_bouncecolorscale` below for affecting bounce color)\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Normal lighting, no added bounce.  Useful for darker shadows, more contrast, and oldschool appearance.\r\n\r\n### `_bouncescale`\r\n* **Type:** float\r\n* **If Set:** Scale factor to multiply the overall bounce brightness by.  Higher values increase brightness while lower reduces it.\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Defaults to 1.\r\n\r\n### `_bouncecolorscale`\r\n* **Type:** float\r\n* **If Set:** Scale factor to use the texture color to affect the color of bounce lighting, 0 to 1.0,  Higher values copy texture color more exactly.  Mimics global illumination by turning all world level surfaces into light sources (mimics real life in this way).\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Defaults to 0, preserves `color` from the light source exactly.\r\n\r\n### `_bouncestyled`\r\n* **Type:** boolean (0 or 1)\r\n* **If Set:** Enables bounce lighting for lights with styles.  This makes flickering, switchable, and glowing lights also have bounce and thereby affect more surfaces.  Useful for them to have more impact on the scene and to increase surprise for switched lights.\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Normal lighting, no added bounce for lights with styles.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n### Sunlight / Environment Lighting\r\n### `_sunlight`\r\n* **Type:** float\r\n* **If Set:** Set the brightness of the sunlight.  Sun's light comes from worldspawn surfaces textured with sky and comes at the level at a particular angle to mimic a sun in the sky.  Does not emit from brush entities textured with sky textures.  Set to greater than 0 to have any effect.  255 is full brightness, but not overbright.  This adds light to the world without needing to place added `light` entities.\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Defaults to 0.  No extra light will be added as though from a sun.\r\n\r\n### `_sunlight_color`\r\n* **Type:** vector (0 to 255)\r\n* **If Set:** Specifies the color for the sun's light.  Specified as 3 values like `0 0 0` (r g b for red green blue).  Useful for having different colored sun or to simulate different times of day such as orange colored sunset.\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Defaults to `255 255 255` for normal white colored light.\r\n\r\n### `_sunlight_mangle` (alternatively `_sun_mangle` for same effect)\r\n* **Type:** vector\r\n* **If Set:** Specifies the direction mangle of the sun's rays.  Specified as 3 values like `0 0 0` (x y z for yaw pitch roll in that order (yes it's an odd order, because it's mangle not angles)).  Useful for having low angled sunlight for sunset/sunrise or other times of day or to have up-angled sunlight for upside-down hanging levels.\r\n> * x (yaw) = set for the compass direction of the sun's angle.  90 points from south towards **north**, 270 from north towards **south**, 0 from west towards **east**, 180 from east towards **west**.  Pick the value desired for the direction your sunlight comes from.  Recommend using a value that is different than these cardinal directions otherwise you might have odd or unnatural lighting on parallel walls.\r\n> * y (pitch) = the up/down angle of the sun.  Negative values angle down towards the ground, positive values angle up towards the sky.  -90 is straight down (high noon), 90 is straight up.  Most maps use a negative value for realistic sun angling.  Values close to 0 will simulate sunset/sunrise, e.g. -10.\r\n> * z (roll) = the twist of the sunlight angle.  Not useful and does nothing..\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Defaults to `0 -90 0' straight down high noon.\r\n\r\n### `_anglescale`\r\n* **Type:** float\r\n* **If Set:** Sunlight angle scale for how much the brightness changes with the difference in sunlight angle and surface normal.  Must be between 0 and 1.0.  Closer to 1 will be brighter at sharper angle and closer to 0 will mean the angle difference has no effect.\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Defaults to 0.5.\r\n\r\n### `_minlight_dirt`\r\n* **Type:** trilean (-1, 0, or 1)\r\n* **If Set:** Affects dirtmapping for any surfaces affected by `_sunlight`.  Dirt adds less brightness along edges between faces depending on how acute the angle is between the face normals.  If `_sunlight` is 0, this has no affect.\r\n> * Set to -1 to disable dirt within `_sunlight`, causes acute corners/edges to be as bright as surrounding surfaces.\r\n> * Set to 0 to use default value specified by `_dirt`.\r\n> * Set to 1 to enable and use dirt mapping on surfaces affected by `_sunlight`.\r\n\r\n### `_sunlight_penumbra`\r\n* **Type:** float\r\n* **If Set:** How wide, in degrees, the `_sunlight` edge is for transition from bright to dark areas where sun cannot reach.  Larger values provide softer edges.  3-4 is a gentle but still distinct edge, 10-20 or more is diffuse like on cloudy/foggy days.\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Defaults to 0, crisp edged shadows.\r\n\r\n### `_sunlight2`\r\n* **Type:** float\r\n* **If Set:** Set the brightness of the upper ambient environment light from all directions.  `_sunlight2` light comes from all worldspawn surfaces textured with sky from every angle.  Does not emit from brush entities textured with sky textures.  Set to greater than 0 to have any effect.  255 is full brightness, but not overbright.  This adds light to the world without needing to place added `light` entities.  Useful for blue contrast lighting from the sky along with orange/yellow `_sunlight` for the sun.  Only affects the top half of the map.\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Defaults to 0.  No extra light will be added as though from a sun.\r\n\r\n### `_sunlight2_color`\r\n* **Type:** vector (0 to 255)\r\n* **If Set:** Specifies the color for the upper ambient environment light.  Specified as 3 values like `0 0 0` (r g b for red green blue).  Recommend picking a color that is complementary (opposite) of the `_sunlight_color`.  Typically a pale blue to simulate sky.  Works best if it matches the skybox average color.  Only affects the top half of the map.\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Defaults to `255 255 255` for normal white colored light.\r\n\r\n### `_sunlight3`\r\n* **Type:** float\r\n* **If Set:** Set the brightness of the lower ambient environment light from all directions.  `_sunlight2` light comes from all worldspawn surfaces textured with sky from every angle.  Does not emit from brush entities textured with sky textures.  Set to greater than 0 to have any effect.  255 is full brightness, but not overbright.  This adds light to the world without needing to place added `light` entities.  Useful for blue contrast lighting from the sky along with orange/yellow `_sunlight` for the sun.  Only affects the bottom half of the map.\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Defaults to 0.  No extra light will be added as though from a sun.\r\n\r\n### `_sunlight3_color`\r\n* **Type:** vector (0 to 255)\r\n* **If Set:** Specifies the color for the lower ambient environment light.  Specified as 3 values like `0 0 0` (r g b for red green blue).  Recommend picking a color that is complementary (opposite) of the `_sunlight_color`.  Typically a pale blue to simulate sky.  Works best if it matches the skybox average color.  Only affects the bottom half of the map.\r\n* **If Left Blank:** Defaults to `255 255 255` for normal white colored light.","n":0.013}}},{"i":499,"$":{"0":{"v":"Miscellaneous","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n#

For any large project, a good structure is important.  Here I provide a files overview and a code overview for the organization and overall workings of the mod.  This is a useful reference if you desire to modify Keep or use and extend it for a mod of your own, which is of course encouraged.  I would be quite hypocritical if I let myself borrow code from everyone and did not return the same favor.  Also, if I were to fade from time and existence, this will help someone be able to pick up and carry the torch.\r\n\r\n## File Organization\r\nEverything is in the `keep/` folder in your Quake install directory.  For example, on Windows: `C:/QUAKE/keep/`.  This is the _working directory_.  For the sake of brevity, I will omit the working directory from in front of amy referenced locations below.\r\n\r\nI keep all files outside of .pak files for ease of development, backup, and github commits.\r\n\r\n### 2D Data\r\n* Sky textures are in `env/gfx/`.  These must be .tga format.\r\n* HUD textures are in `env/`.  These must be .lmp format.  Some HUD textures are in `keep/gfx.wad`, however.\r\n* Override textures are in `textures/`.  These must be .tga format and are typically used to support alpha channel transparency where crisp masking is not desired, but rather smooth transparency.\r\n* Map textures are compiled into the .bsp files, located in `maps/`\r\n\r\n### 3D Data\r\n* All 3D models are in `progs/`.  These must be .mdl format.\r\n\r\n### Text Data\r\n* Particle effect specifications are in `keep/effectinfo.txt` file.  These are used by DP/FTE/QSS family of engines for specialized particle effects referenced by text name in QuakeC.\r\n* Readme is here online, not bundled with the mod currently.\r\n\r\n### Audio Data\r\n* All sounds are in `sounds/`.  These must be .wav, .mp3, or .ogg.\r\n\r\n### Code\r\n* The meat and potatoes of the mod are stored in `keepsrc/`.  These must be .qc files for ssqc normal progs.dat (main game code) and .csqc for csprogs.dat (HUD and effects).  The compile list and inclusion is in the progs.src file in here.\r\n* CSQC code is in `keepsrc/csqc/`.\r\n* I've included each build of fteqccgui.exe that was used to compile the progs.dat in `keepsrc/` and the csprogs.dat in `keepsrc/csqc`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Code Organization\r\nHere the organization of functions and general practice for the code is given, along with my reasonings for my particular code style.\r\n\r\n**Of brackets and one line ifs and compressed locals on the same line:** when working on code, a lot of time can be spent scrolling up and down within a file.  To save myself countless hours of scrolling, I've established a habit of minimizing vertical padding wherever possible, but without compromising readability. This is why `{` are always on the same line as function names and `else`'s or `else if`s, one line ifs are kept on the same line, and many ai functions of the form `monster_anim# [$frame, next] will have their ai_*(); function and any trivial function calls all on one line.  Also multiple same type locals are `,`'ed together on one line.  Where these vertical space saving conventions aren't followed, it indicates untouched code directly copied and used as-is, or at least almost untouched.\r\n\r\nMost of the time, though not all, I've made separate .qc files for different mods, particularly for defs, subs, projectiles, and effects (fx).\r\n\r\n# Useful Functions\r\nHere there be dragons.  Use at your own risk of fun or otherwise.  Maphacks are nonstandard usage and can have bad side effects, but can lead to some fun and interesting results.  This is not a complete listing of every function in the mod, but it provides a common listing of _hook_ functions useful for hacks.  A _hook_ function is one that lets you change a state or condition with minimal side effects.  This could be anything from a delayed spawn, to a precache, or simply to use the brush model (aka bmodel).  Some of these were made just for hacks...and nothing else!  Who knew!\r\n\r\nThis listing is also useful if you are extending Keep to make a mod of your own.  Please also refer to the Mod Structure above for a guide on the code organization.\r\n\r\nSpecial Note:  There are many useful added entities from many mods; so many, in fact, that there probably already exists a documented entity for what you are trying to achieve.","n":0.03}}},{"i":500,"$":{"0":{"v":"Health and Damage","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n# Player Health\r\n## Player Health Overview\r\nPlayer health starts at 100.  Death occurs when reaching 0 health and a message\r\ndisplays at the top of tue screen for why you died; useful to see the name of\r\nwhat killed you.\r\n\r\n`TIP: Press console key (default is tilde ~, but may be ^ Â° on German\r\nkeyboards) to access the console to read messages that you may have missed.`\r\n\r\nMaximum player health is typically 100.  There are exceptions:\r\n* The megahealth powerup raises health over the normal maximum up to a\r\n  _megamax_ value of 250.\r\n* Evil Mode lowers max health to 50 but does not affect megamax.\r\n\r\n## Damage to Player\r\nTypically damage dealt is one for one:  1 damage removes 1 health.  Damage is\r\ncalculated internally as a fractional floating point value subtracted from\r\nhealth and the resultant health is rounded up to the nearest whole value. The\r\nreason for fractional calculations is due to armor resistance being calculated\r\nas a percentage.\r\n\r\nPlayers can receive various other items in addition to armor that affect how or\r\nif they are damaged and by what kinds of damage.  See [[items.protection]] for\r\nmore details.  Damage from environmental sources will ignore armor, for\r\ninstance lava, slime, and drowning will affect only a player's health and not\r\ntheir armor.","n":0.071}}},{"i":501,"$":{"0":{"v":"Data Types","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"Data types are handled somewhat oddly by the game code written in QuakeC.

Keep contains support for almost 200 different enemies.  Many have alternate skins or upgraded versions such as the ogre family, death knight brigade, grunts, and enforcers.  Here, all attributes and options for how to use enemies in the Keep mod are listed and explained.  I use the term _attribute_ to describe both `key|value` pairs and spawn flag options (technically `spawnflags` is itself a `key` with a `value`).  All enemies can be placed as-is without setting or changing any attributes, including bosses.  Most other mods require special setups for their bosses but Keep allows any enemy to be used as if it were a normal monster.  Special boss setups are still supported.\n\n# Table Of Contents","n":0.089}}},{"i":505,"$":{"0":{"v":"Tether

All enemies start with `monster_` in their entity's classname.\n\nFor understanding the `Type` given below, refer to [[general.data-types]].\n\n## Spawnflags\n\n### `spawnflags`\n* **Type:** integer\n* **If Set:** This value is a decimal value used as on/off bits.  Each bit indicates whether to use or don't use a certain option.  The sum of the decimal values is the resultant `value` of the `key` called `spawnflags` (Recall that Quake uses `key|value` pairs on all entities to specify data about that entity, for instance `targetname|hello` gives that entity the name of \"hello\").  For spawnflags, level editors let you check off check boxes to select certain options.  The values are summed together to give the `value` to `spawnflags`; for instance checking 2, 4, and 8 gives a summed `value` of `14`.  Since each value is equal to the binary equivalent of 1, 10, 100, 1000, etc. each sum is inherently unique and guarantees that only certain digit places are changed from 0 to 1.  The maximum number of bits available is 24. `Technical Note: since Quake uses 32 bit floats, you might wonder why we can't use all 32.  The remaining bits would be used to indicate positive/negative and to specify power to raise to such as 2 for squared, but Quake's parser doesn't look at these for spawnflags.`\n\n|Number|Name|Desription|\n|------|----|----------|\n|1|Ambush|This makes enemies not react to nearby angry monsters or noises of the player.

This prevents them from making the usual teleport sound or teleglitter effects when they spawn in.|\n|64| Delay Spawn |Super useful. Makes it such that monster will only spawn in when targeted.  Monster will spawn right where placed, if there's room.  Only spawns once. In standard Quake (also lovingly referred to as \"vanilla\"), it was necessary to have the monster standing in a place such as a separate box off to the side of the map with a `trigger_teleport` on top of them that would be `target`ed to have them teleport in to an `info_teleport_destination`.  This is no longer necessary by using this spawnflag and reduces the complexity for teleporting in monsters.}\n|128| Angry |  This causes the monster to spawn angry at the player as if the monster had seen the player.  Usually used along with 64 Delay Spawn to have monsters teleport in angry, but also possible to have monster start angry at level start.

Typically health is much higher than standard enemies, or at least higher than a Shambler.\n\nAny boss can be a normal monster.  One of Keep's mantras is that \"the mapper is always right\", and thus Keep allows you to use a monster however you want, with or without special setup. \n Historically, bosses in Quake have been used in special setups, alone or with underlings.  Keep makes it such that any monster can be used as a normal enemy or a boss.\n\nAny monster can be a boss, it merely depends on the context. It is also possible to override default monster values such as `health` and `deathstring`.  `deathstring` should start with a space and reference being killed by the monsters `netname`.  For instance `\" was tusk-skewered by a raging Wildebeast.\"` (without quotes when entered in the map editor).  This gets put in a statement immediately after the player's netname in the displayed message at the top of the screen whenever the player dies, example: `Ranger was tusk-skewered by a raging Wildebeast.` \n\n## Purpose of This Page\n* Show what is somewhat hidden: Many bosses are simply variants of existing enemies and are only able to be used by placing a normal enemy and then checking the appropriate spawnflag.  Even more hidden, some boss variants are determined (historical implementation) by their skin color or some other attribute specified by the mapper.  In some more obscure or potentially confusing instances, these have been made into separately listed entities with their own names for ease of discovery and implementation.\n* This listing is meant to provide a helpful understanding of the possible end battles available in Keep without having to read through every available monster in the very long full list.

Josiah Jack (Qmaster) (known as Bubby to his 3 sisters).\r\n\r\nI like to self describe myself as `Christian, Husband, Father, Engineer`.  In\r\nthis order of importance.\r\n- Christian - I am baptized into the name of the almighty creator God, Jesus\r\n  Christ, King of the World.  My theology drives my actions.  I can best be\r\n  summarized as postmillenial preterist paedocommunionist paedobaptist though\r\n  such terms are a woeful oversimplification of the grandeur and beauty that\r\n  is found in the Bible, the Word of God, and its symbolic and typological\r\n  worldview of which I am ever shaped and striving to have my mind healed from\r\n  the influences of evil to conform to.\r\n- Husband - Maried to one wife, of whom I am thankful for putting up with my\r\n  many sleepless nights of pouring myself into my projects.  My rock canyon\r\n  country hiking partner.  Listed before and as more important than being a\r\n  parent since I will only be in charge of my children for a brief part of\r\n  their lives, but I am married for all of my life.  May we ever grow closer\r\n  together as our decades go on.\r\n- Father - I am the father of 3 children.  Two of which are born, the 3rd is on\r\n  her way.  My daughter is adopted and in my care since she was 20min old.  We\r\n  became pregnant with my son only a few months after we adopted her.  They\r\n  are both very smart and the cutest kids you've ever seen.  We'll likely have\r\n  a 4th someday at least.\r\n- Engineer - This seems the best term to describe how I interact with my world.\r\n  In every area of life this describes how I strive to take dominion of the\r\n  earth for the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, moving everthing I touch from glory to\r\n  glory ever improving, beautifying, and making it the best it can be.  You may\r\n  notice I haven't described my job at all yet; this is because I do not find\r\n  my life purpose in what I am currently doing for money, but rather in what I\r\n  am currently doing for Christ.  That said, I am presently employed as an\r\n  Embedded Software Engineer helping to make the best equipment for connecting\r\n  people with utilities they need; this helps to move history forward from\r\n  Garden to Garden City.  As a programmer I, like God, use the power of the\r\n  written word to change the world.  My engineering is not limited to career,\r\n  as I engineer systems for my game projects, shape my yard into gardens, mod\r\n  my cars to look better than factory, and improve my house always striving to\r\n  leave a place better than I found it.  True engineering is dominioneering.\r\n\r\n#### Other  Interests\r\nUtah and the Coloradeau Plateau in general, canyons, rocks (red or otherwise),\r\nLegos, sci-fi tech, Linux, building computers, learning, programming, 3D\r\nmodeling, rendering, dabbling in any digital medium such as video or audio\r\nediting, water color painting, world map drawing, concept art, graph paper\r\nsketches, Quake mapping, blacked-out wheels and trim on silver vehicles, off\r\nroad vehicle mods, gardening, puzzles, detective TV shows, history, ancient\r\nartifacts and architecture, theoretical physics and alternate theories from\r\nmainstream, exploring\r\n","n":0.014}}},{"i":694,"$":{"0":{"v":"Tools","n":1},"1":{"v":"In the making of Keep, these are the tools that were used for the compilation\nof it all.\n\n* fteqccgui\n* notepad\n* Notepad++\n* Visual Studio Code\n* Wally\n* J.A.C.K (formerly Jackhammer)\n* Worldcraft 3.3 with patch\n* Trenchbroom\n* Adquedit\n* fimg\n* Unity3D\n* Nifty (by Qmaster using Unity3D)\n* QME 2.1\n* QME 3.0\n* QME 3.1\n* TexMex\n* ericw compilers\n* Tyrutils compilers\n* TreeQBSP\n* TxQBSP\n* FTE\n* Quakespasm-Spiked\n* Quakespasm\n* vkQuake\n* ironwail\n* DarkPlaces\n* MarkV\n* Zsh\n* OhMyZsh\n* powerlevel10k\n* tmux","n":0.125}}},{"i":695,"$":{"0":{"v":"Brush Entities","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"There are two types of entities in Quake, brush based and point based.

Whenever an entity would have\ntouched it if it were solid, then it causes its `touch` function to run.  This\nis used to trigger events.  This could be as mundane as the typical target IO,\nperform a special action, or acting upon the entities that touched it.\n\nThere is no real limit to what behavior a trigger can have or on who or what\ncan trigger it.  Different triggers are normally configured to be either player\nonly, monster only, projectile only, or some combination.\n\n---\n\n## Extras Emitters\n\n> Attributions: Frank Condello (aka pOx), Khreathor for the extras_r5 update\n\nSpecialty particles and emitters that react to physics, and their affectors.\n\nParticle systems with QuakeC - packet overflows made easy!\nThese were modeled after particle systems in high-end 3D apps, they are not\nthe most user friendly entities around...\n\nEMITTER ENTITIES: func_emitter, func_emitter_volume\nEFFECTOR TRIGGERS: t_effector_destroy, t_effector_push, t_effector_gravity,\nt_effector_trubulence, t_effector_attract, t_effector_friction\n\nEmitters generate a \"particle\" (either a .spr, .mdl or .bsp) and toss it in\na direction between the set angle limits. They can use an optional \"death\"\nmodel to simulate anything from rain, falling rubble, blasts of flames,\nforcefields, whatever...\n\nEffectors change the behaviour of particles that touch them (the emitter \nmust have the \"USEEFFECTORS\" spawnflag set).  Emitters can be attached to a \nfunc_train_ext, for some really neat crap :)\n\nDon't go too nuts with these, stay away from the built-in sounds for high\nfrequency emitters (use fx_sound instead) and just use common sense (you \ndon't need a gib fountain around every corner!).  Fine Tronyn...do whatever!\n\nThere are a LOT of options - these are really generic and need to be\ntailored to specifc purposes.\n\nThe lifespan of animated particles may not be exact - it will always fall on\na multiple of the framerate (this usually isn't a problem, since framerates\nare typically much smaller than lifespans) but you should be aware of this\nlimitation.\n\nParticles won't \"die\" when they hit another particle - this is on purpose.\n\nParticles don't register a touch on water, but a t_effector_destroy trigger \ncan be used to simulate this. Set KILLINFWATER to have them die in \nfunc_water volumes.\n\nANGLES EXPLAINED:\nThe angle limits may take a while to get used to, but it's a really powerful\nway to control the direction and spread. Start by setting just v1 and h1 to\nget a tight stream in the general direction, then adjust v1/v2 and h1/h2 to\nwithin a few degrees (plus and minus) of the original value to increase the\nspread for a cone-shaped fountain. Ommit either h2 or v2 for a fan shaped\nemission, or set v1=1 v2=360 h1=1 h2=360 for a fire-works style spherical\nburst.\n\nThe following diagram visualizes the horizontal and vertical angle relationship.\n\n![Emitter Angles](assets/img/emitter_angles.gif)\n\nWhen viewing a map from the top, an H angle value of 270 points up, and\nmoves clockwise, making right 360 (or 0), down 90 and left 180. Same goes\nfor the V angle when viewed from the front.\n\nThe particle spread is always contained from the first angle (h1/v1) to the\nsecond angle (h2/v2), going clockwise. So h1=10 h2=350 is NOT the same as \nh1=350 h2=10. (the first is a near circular spread, while the second is a\ntight 20Âº fan shaped spread).\n\nAlso note that although 0 would normally be a valid replacement for 360, you\nshould use a range of 1 - 360 as a value of 0 is simply ignored (though this\nmay be desirable in certain situations).","n":0.043}}},{"i":697,"$":{"0":{"v":"T_effector_trubulence","n":1}}},{"i":698,"$":{"0":{"v":"T_effector_push","n":1}}},{"i":699,"$":{"0":{"v":"T_effector_gravity","n":1}}},{"i":700,"$":{"0":{"v":"T_effector_friction","n":1},"1":{"v":"> Attributions: Frank Condello (aka pOx), Khreathor for the extras_r5 update\n\nApplies friction to particles, slowing them down (negative values speed\nparticles up).\n\nSince this is a part of the extras_r5 Emitters system, please refer to system\ndetail here: [[brush-entities.triggers]]\n\n### Key/Values\n- \"speed\"\t\tAmount of Friction (max 100 = dead stop, negative values can go\n                further though -200 etc.)\n- \"count\"\t\tOverride the default 100% of particles affected (valid: 1-99\n                i.e 50 affects roughly 50% of the particles)\n- \"targetname\"\tCan be enabled/disabled\n\n### Spawnflags\n-  1 - \"START_ON\"......Start in enabled state even if targeted","n":0.11}}},{"i":701,"$":{"0":{"v":"T_effector_destroy","n":1},"1":{"v":"> Attributions: Frank Condello (aka pOx), Khreathor for the extras_r5 update\n\nKills particles that touch it.\n\nSince this is a part of the extras_r5 Emitters system, please refer to system\ndetail here: [[brush-entities.triggers]]\n\n### Key/Values\n- \"count\"\t\tOverride the default 100% obliteration (valid: 1-99 i.e 50\n                affects roughly 50% of the particles)\n- \"targetname\"\tCan be enabled/disabled\n\n### Spawnflags\n-  1 - \"START_ON\"......Start in enabled state even if targeted","n":0.13}}},{"i":702,"$":{"0":{"v":"T_effector_attract","n":1},"1":{"v":"> Attributions: Frank Condello (aka pOx), Khreathor for the extras_r5 update\n\nParticles touching this trigger are attracted to it's center.
