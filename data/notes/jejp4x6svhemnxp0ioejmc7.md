## Keep itself
Since this is a compilation mod, it has had development by a large number of
different people over the past 25+ years of Quake modding history.  This first
section lists just the credit for the compilation itself, authors of its custom
additions that are unique to Keep.

Consider each and every one of these as a sincerest thank you.  You all are
amazing!

### Keep Credits - Coupled with Mjölnir
As Mjölnir is the primary user of Keep much in the same way that Tronyn's early
projects were the primary users of Drake, the Mjölnir team is intertwined with
Keep's development, especially over these last few years, to bring about the
most amazing maps and features ever seen in Quake.  The combined efforts of any
who helped to make both Mjölnir and to make Keep itself and its content are
thus given below.  Please see [Mjölnir](TODO Add link).

  this readme, testing, level design, more code, texturing, support, concept art

  even crazier amount of level design, and all the crazy cool ideas Qmaster was
  crazy enough to actually implement

### Special note for Mjölnir:
The completion of this free, open-source, and totally non-commercial game
project has been made possible by the 2021 support of the [University of
Manitoba Department of Icelandic Language and Literature](https://umanitoba.ca/arts/icelandic), Faculty of Arts
(Endowment Fund) and English Department (DETFM).  Thanks to PJ Buchan and
Catari Gauthier of the Icelandic Department, and to Katrín Nielsdóttir and Ryan
E. Johnson of [The Icelandic Collection](https://libguides.lib.umanitoba.ca/c.php?g=723161), where Mackenzie Stewart's World Map
painting and other contents of this project were displayed as part of [Creation
Myths of the North in Fall of 2022](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ox6xa6qi6jpspv7/Icelandic.Department.Christmas.Newsletter.pdf?dl=0)

.

---
Reiterating that this is primarily a compilation mod, at least in terms of
content quantity, the following sections will list the credits for all of the
mods and projects used.

For what is and isn't implemented, refer to the
[Checklist](https://github.com/JosiahJack/KeepModReadme/blob/master/KeepFeatureChecklist.xlsx)

I have attempted to be thorough here, no etc.'s allowed, but please email me
if I left your name out of this list: josiahjackcitadel AT gmail.com
Also of note, I have included all the various readmes from the different mods
used in Keep into the `keep/credits` folder as many require this.  Further,
each mod's content is sorted into named folders within various sections of
progs and sounds and in the qcsources.  Attributions are given on each qc file
in keepsrc as well.

The credits listed below were taken from the respective readmes of each release
or in cases where no readme was present from the sources I obtained them from.

Care has been taken to include all names and teams credited in each respective
mod within the `Per Project Credit Listing` below to ensure that each mod has
its credits intact.

The full name listing below is the complete compilation of all individuals
named who contributed to any of the mods and projects included, no matter how
trivial there contribution.  In some respects this will be a list of people who
have touched Quake in significant ways over these many years since 1996.

## Sourced Projects/Mods List Alphabatized
Please note this excludes single authors releasing files individually (e.g.
Madfox).  For that see the authors list at the bottom of the page.  Some of
these are single map releases.  This lists all mods used in full or in part,
even if just one file or sky was used, even if not implemented and files are
available for later planned implementation.

Also note that while a mod is listed, it may only have contributed a tiny part
to Keep and may not be fully subsumed into the collective as of yet.

Parentheses contain the abbreviation commonly associated with a project.

## Per Project Credit Listing
Here I provide the credits for each mod as provided at the time of mod release
from the mods' documentation.  Please note this is the people, not the mods.

discovered it.

## About the Compiler
The Compiler: W. Josiah Jack (Qmaster) (known as Bubby to his 3 sisters).

I like to self describe myself as `Christian, Husband, Father, Engineer`.  In
this order of importance.
- Christian - I am baptized into the name of the almighty creator God, Jesus
  Christ, King of the World.  My theology drives my actions.  I can best be
  summarized as postmillenial preterist paedocommunionist paedobaptist though
  such terms are a woeful oversimplification of the grandeur and beauty that
  is found in the Bible, the Word of God, and its symbolic and typological
  worldview of which I am ever shaped and striving to have my mind healed from
  the influences of evil to conform to.
- Husband - Maried to one wife, of whom I am thankful for putting up with my
  many sleepless nights of pouring myself into my projects.  My rock canyon
  country hiking partner.  Listed before and as more important than being a
  parent since I will only be in charge of my children for a brief part of
  their lives, but I am married for all of my life.  May we ever grow closer
  together as our decades go on.
- Father - I am the father of 3 children.  Two of which are born, the 3rd is on
  her way.  My daughter is adopted and in my care since she was 20min old.  We
  became pregnant with my son only a few months after we adopted her.  They
  are both very smart and the cutest kids you've ever seen.  We'll likely have
  a 4th someday at least.
- Engineer - This seems the best term to describe how I interact with my world.
  In every area of life this describes how I strive to take dominion of the
  earth for the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, moving everthing I touch from glory to
  glory ever improving, beautifying, and making it the best it can be.  You may
  notice I haven't described my job at all yet; this is because I do not find
  my life purpose in what I am currently doing for money, but rather in what I
  am currently doing for Christ.  That said, I am presently employed as an
  Embedded Software Engineer helping to make the best equipment for connecting
  people with utilities they need; this helps to move history forward from
  Garden to Garden City.  As a programmer I, like God, use the power of the
  written word to change the world.  My engineering is not limited to career,
  as I engineer systems for my game projects, shape my yard into gardens, mod
  my cars to look better than factory, and improve my house always striving to
  leave a place better than I found it.  True engineering is dominioneering.
