<p>There are various invisible entities that control different aspects of the game and handle triggering and using the functions of other entities.  These are useful in many situations and allow for a large amount of flexibility in setups and creating special events, large and small.</p>

<h3 id="info_player_start"><code>info_player_start</code><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#info_player_start"></a></h3>
<p>Starting point for the player in single player games.  Also used as one of the spawn points for coop.  Placing more than one will create a warning, should only ever be 1, which is why we have...</p>
<h3 id="info_player_startdev"><code>info_player_startdev</code><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#info_player_startdev"></a></h3>
<p>Forced to use and only used as starting point if <code>developer</code> is 1.  Useful for immediately starting in area of the map for testing without having to noclip over there.</p>
<h3 id="info_player_coop"><code>info_player_coop</code><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#info_player_coop"></a></h3>
<p>Starting point for coop players.  Coop players will start here first, if present, before picking the <code>info_player_start</code> instead.  <code>spawnflags</code> 64 will cause this to start off.  Can be enabled or disabled using the entity state system (see below).</p>
<h3 id="info_player_start2"><code>info_player_start2</code><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#info_player_start2"></a></h3>
<p>Secondary starting point for the player in single player games.  Player will spawn here if serverflag bitmask value 16, 32, or 64 is true or if player had all 4 runes in previous map.</p>
<h3 id="info_player_coop2"><code>info_player_coop2</code><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#info_player_coop2"></a></h3>
<p>Secondary starting point for the player in coop games.  Player will spawn here if serverflag bitmask value 16, 32, or 64 is true or if player had all 4 runes in previous map.  Coop players will start here first, if present and met the above conditions, before picking the <code>info_player_start2</code> instead.  <code>spawnflags</code> 64 will cause this to start off.  Can be enabled or disabled using the entity state system (see below).</p>
<h3 id="info_player_deathmatch-"><code>info_player_deathmatch </code><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#info_player_deathmatch-"></a></h3>

<p>Skyroom camera for QSS/FTE engines for implementation of 3D skyboxes.  Automatically sets worldspawn's <code>_skyroom</code> value to the origin vector of the location of this entity.  Overrides worldspawn.  Only 1 should be used.  If using multiple, the last one placed in the map editor will be used.</p>

Pitch is up and down, negative to look up, positive to look down.  Yaw is the rotation left and right and is same as when setting monster facing direction (e.g. 90 is north, 270 south etc.). Roll is if you want to look at something sideways, positive to tilt your head to the right, negative to tilt your head to the left, 180 to flip upside-down.|

|targetname|string|Name of this entity for use by others either as reference or to trigger the <code>use</code> function on this entity.|
|use|string|Name of the function to execute when this is targeted. Specify as it is found in the qc code, for instance <code>func_door_use</code>, without quotes. Requires a <code>targetname</code>|

<h1 id="entity-state-system">Entity State System<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#entity-state-system"></a></h1>
<p>When the Arcane Dimensions mod came out, it introduced a novel idea for handling the enabling and disabling of various entities, including triggers.  Quoting its description here:</p>
<p><code>When Quake first came out there were strict limitations on how many entities could exist and be active at the same time. The quick fix solution to this problem was to use the ``killtarget`` key so that entities could be removed.  This was a very powerful feature with very few restrictions on what it  could affect or destroy at the same time.</code></p>
<p><code>The idea of the entity state system is to create a way to safely switch entities on, off or have then temporarily disabled. This will help prevent situations where entity chains are broken or strange errors occur because the touch function does not have an entity anymore.</code></p>
<p><code>The entity state is a new key on entities which is designed to work in a passive mode until it is activated. All the entities listed below have a default value so that any existing map will still work as before.</code></p>
<p><code>There are two methods for changing the entity state and the first method is an extra key on ``trigger`` entities (_once, _multi, _relay etc)</code></p>
<p><code>The second method is via a brand new set of entities which can affect  multiple targets at once and are much easier (visually) to see what is going on because most editors draw target lines.</code></p>
