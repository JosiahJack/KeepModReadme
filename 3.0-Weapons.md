There are numerous weapons available.  Below is a chart listing each weapon with its stats.  The impulse value given below is the internal number used by the code to switch to that weapon; this can be used via the console by entering `impulse ###` console command and replacing \### with the desired number from below to switch directly to that weapon without the need for pressing a slot's keyboard key multiple times.  Also possible to add new keybinds for specific weapons by adding `"bind" "keyhere" "impulse ###"` in your config.cfg file and changing "keyhere" to desired keyboard key.  The weapon has to have been picked up first.

Further down is a chart listing the keyboard key defaults for each weapon 'slot' and the weapons in that slot.  Pressing the keyboard key will first switch to the first weapon in the slot that the player has in inventory; further presses of the same key will cycle through the weapons in the slot.

Some weapons are _override_ weapons.  An override will fully replace a weapon in its slot, for instance the Shadow Axe replaces the standard Axe.  Overrides are not given by CheatCommand, refer to [Cheat Codes](https://github.com/JosiahJack/KeepModReadme/wiki/9.0-Cheat-Codes) for more info.
