# Axe

#### `weapon_axe`

### Normal Effects
Weakest weapon. Simple axe with a few different swing angles. Possible to
change visual appearance from ID1 axe model to AD axe by setting `useold_axe`
to 1 in worldspawn. The AD axe will better match the shadow axe upgrade. See
the [Shadow Axe](3.32-weapon_upgrade_axe.md).  Guarantees that enemies who have
longer pain animations will always go into the longer animations enabling
higher chance of player to land more hits; this aids in axe only map starts or
maps with low ammo.

### Tome of Power Effects
Double damage and guarateed to gib zombies standing or laying. This is more
than simply upgrading to the shadow axe's behavior. Throws out extra gibs.
