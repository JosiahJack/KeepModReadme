Quoting its description here:</p>\n<p><code>When Quake first came out there were strict limitations on how many entities could exist and be active at the same time. The quick fix solution to this problem was to use the ``killtarget`` key so that entities could be removed.  This was a very powerful feature with very few restrictions on what it  could affect or destroy at the same time.</code></p>\n<p><code>The idea of the entity state system is to create a way to safely switch entities on, off or have then temporarily disabled. This will help prevent situations where entity chains are broken or strange errors occur because the touch function does not have an entity anymore.</code></p>\n<p><code>The entity state is a new key on entities which is designed to work in a passive mode until it is activated. All the entities listed below have a default value so that any existing map will still work as before.</code></p>\n<p><code>There are two methods for changing the entity state and the first method is an extra key on ``trigger`` entities (_once, _multi, _relay etc)</code></p>\n<p><code>The second method is via a brand new set of entities which can affect  multiple targets at once and are much easier (visually) to see what is going on because most editors draw target lines.</code></p>\n<h2 id=\"entity-state-information-table\">Entity State Information Table<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#entity-state-information-table\"></a></h2>\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<table><thead><tr><th>Estate Action</th><th>Estate Condition Result</th><th>Description of Action</th><th>Description of State</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Disable</td><td>DISABLED</td><td>Puts entity into DISABLED state.</td><td>Blocks any targeted ability or entity functionality and turns off any visual aids like animated textures.</td></tr><tr><td>Turn Off</td><td>OFF</td><td>Puts into OFF state</td><td>Block all of the designed functionality and hide the entity entirely from interaction with the player.</td></tr><tr><td>Enable</td><td>ON</td><td>Puts into ON state</td><td>(Default) Allows the entity to work as designed, be targeted and physically exist as per its setup</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/KeepModReadme/notes/76to6fztygwk9bqxj663bx2\">Common Attributes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/KeepModReadme/notes/2k24uzhmr4ibcm0cbuxnofv\">Ambients and Sound Effects</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/KeepModReadme/notes/n1nwyx0vpjmxwhft2gc51o6\">Point Entities</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","title":"TOME OF KEEP MOD","desc":"","updated":1682424325599,"created":1657642701590,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"KeepModReadme"},"contentHash":"4c52ea882ee2e021d34960efe1b0ae09","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"general","position":{"start":{"line":73,"column":3,"offset":4311},"end":{"line":73,"column":14,"offset":4322},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"general"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"credits","position":{"start":{"line":74,"column":3,"offset":4325},"end":{"line":74,"column":14,"offset":4336},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"credits"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"enemies","position":{"start":{"line":75,"column":3,"offset":4339},"end":{"line":75,"column":14,"offset":4350},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"enemies"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"weapons","position":{"start":{"line":76,"column":3,"offset":4353},"end":{"line":76,"column":14,"offset":4364},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"weapons"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"items","position":{"start":{"line":77,"column":3,"offset":4367},"end":{"line":77,"column":12,"offset":4376},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"items"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"traps","position":{"start":{"line":78,"column":3,"offset":4379},"end":{"line":78,"column":12,"offset":4388},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"traps"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"brush-entities","position":{"start":{"line":79,"column":3,"offset":4391},"end":{"line":79,"column":21,"offset":4409},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"brush-entities"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"point-entities","position":{"start":{"line":80,"column":3,"offset":4412},"end":{"line":80,"column":21,"offset":4430},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"point-entities"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"opv748qnyh2uwtk20mh0548","vaultName":"KeepModReadme"},"value":"requirements","position":{"start":{"line":81,"column":3,"offset":4433},"end":{"line":81,"column":19,"offset":4449},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"requirements"}}],"anchors":{"current-version":{"type":"header","text":"Current Version:","value":"current-version","line":7,"column":0,"depth":4},"compiled-and-edited-by-w-josiah-jack-aka-qmaster--aug-23-2008-to-2024":{"type":"header","text":"Compiled and Edited by W.

Within these dusty pages you may find a detailed technical explanation of what I have discovered and kept on my many travels in the land of Quake.\n\nWhat started as an effort to add a few items from both mission packs into one single player level eventually grew over time to be a massive compilation of features from across the Quake community.\nThis mod for the first [Quake (1996)](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake) is primarily a full combination of the following mods’ enemies, weapons, items, traps, and other features in addition to\nmy own features:\n* Standard Quake (ID1)........[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake)]\n* Mission Pack 1 (Hipnotic)...[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake_Mission_Pack_1:_Scourge_of_Armagon)]\n* Mission Pack 2 (Rogue)......[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake_Mission_Pack_2:_Dissolution_of_Eternity)]\n* Arcane Dimensions (AD) [[link](http://www.simonoc.com/pages/design/sp/ad.htm)] [[mirror](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/ad_v1_80p1final.html)]\n* Drake (SOE, etc.) [[link](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/something_wicked.html)]\n* Quoth [[quoth 1](https://www.quaddicted.com/webarchive/kell.quaddicted.com/) [[quoth 2.2](https://tomeofpreach.wordpress.com/quoth/)]\n* Kinn (Marcher, etc.) [[marcher](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/kinn_marcher.html) [[bastion](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/kinn_bastion.html)]\n* Custents [[link](https://www.quakewiki.net/quake-1/mods/custents-custom-entities/)]\n* extras_r5 [[link](https://github.com/khreathor/extras_r5)] [[extras_r4 (older)](https://www.quakewiki.net/quake-1/mods/extras-r4/)] [[docs](http://khreathor.xyz/jam/extras/index.html)]\n* Nehahra [[link](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/nehahra.html)]\n* Rubicon and Rubicon 2 [[rubicon](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/rubicon.html)] [[rubicon2](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/rubicon2.html)] [[rrp](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/rrp.html)]\n* Other various community contributions, refer to the Credits\n\n\nArcane Dimensions serves as the primary base for all added content due to its excellent formatting, enhanced enemy infighting code, and excellent structure.\n\nAny conflicts have been resolved in such a manner as to retain the unique features of the primary mods above, for instance by using spawnflags, such that any mod's conflicting variant is avaialable.\nThe entity definition file (.fgd) contains all the necessary fields and spawnflags for accessing these conflict resolving features as well as any Keep specific features that have been added.\n\nAll features of this mod are documented here in their various sections.  A complete entity list can be found in the appendix.  In every section the entities are listed alphabetically by entity name.\n\nFor what is and isn't implemented, refer to the [Checklist](https://github.com/JosiahJack/Keep/blob/master/KeepFeatureChecklist.xlsx)\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe purpose of this mod is to provide a toolset for creating any kind of Quake\nmap you desire with anything you may have encountered in some of the best known\nmods.  This mod is a mod for mappers, intended for mappers to make excellent\nmaps for players to play.  Also, in the spirit of the earliest days of Quake,\nthis mod is not striving for overall quality, nor quantity, but is intending to\nprovide fun.  Some content is intentionally as-is, in terms of quality, to\npreserve the old-school 90's feel; other content is much more polished.  The\nquality of content you use is up to you, the mapper.\n\n> The mapper is always right.  The player is at the mercy of the mapper.\n\n# TABLE OF CONTENTS\nHere are links to each book within the tome.\n\n* [[general]]\n* [[credits]]\n* [[enemies]]\n* [[weapons]]\n* [[items]]\n* [[traps]]\n* [[brush-entities]]\n* [[point-entities]]\n* [[requirements]]\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nDISCLAIMERS:\nThe contents herein may have originally derived from other authors.  I make no claim that the full contents are an original work, rather only the compilation as such is original.
