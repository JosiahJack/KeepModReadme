# Thunderbolt

#### `weapon_lightning`

### Normal Effects
Fires a continuous stream of lightning.  Discharging in the water causes damage
in a 35 * cells radius with 35 * cells damage, then drains cells to 0. Also
known informally as the "Lightning Gun".

Namesake of the "Lightning Gun Effect" trope:  The most powerful weapon gets
used the least because players will always want to save it just in case.

### Tome of Power Effects
Double damage and throws sparks.
