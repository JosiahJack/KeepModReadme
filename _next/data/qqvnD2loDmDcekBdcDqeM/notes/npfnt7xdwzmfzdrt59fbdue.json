Keep uses the many developer assistance additions added by AD: Arrows are placed on path_corners, Delay(64) spawn monsters and invisible info entities are marked with 3D diamond markers, entities with setup errors are marked with yellow diamonds, numerous messages are logged in the console about the level settings and any errors found in setup.</td></tr><tr><td>god</td><td></td><td>Toggles on/off with each use.  Player becomes invincible and pentagram protection sound plays when damage would have been dealt.</td></tr><tr><td>noclip</td><td></td><td>Toggles on/off with each use. Player becomes nonsolid and unaffected by gravity.  Used for flying through walls and outside the level.  Super helpful to skip sections to spotcheck areas of a level during testing of a map during development or to take screenshots from outside the level looking in.</td></tr><tr><td>notarget</td><td></td><td>Toggles on/off with each use.  Makes player invisible to enemies and triggers.  AD also prevented item pickup but I have reenabled the old vanilla behavior and let players still pick things up for testing.  Noclip can be used if you want to avoid picking something up during testing.</td></tr><tr><td>fly</td><td></td><td>Toggles on/off with each use.  Disables gravity for the player.  Player still collides with everything.  Useful flying through to test collisions in anticipation of enemy knockback or rocket jumping.</td></tr><tr><td>impulse</td><td>1 through 255</td><td>Used for switching weapons on weapon slots or direct to weapons within slots.  Also used with various numbers for special cheats.

Kept from the age old days of early Keep when impulse 9 was assigned to the laser cannon prior to knowing you could bind the 9 key to a separate impulse.</td></tr><tr><td>145</td><td>Start intermission screen</td></tr><tr><td>182</td><td>Display Secrets.  Take a noclip tour through the map to the location of each secret trigger.  Some secret triggers are not touchable and will be placed by the mapper at their discretion (usually nearby but could be anywhere).</td></tr><tr><td>211</td><td>KillRay.  Initial mode is Instakill.  Anytime ths player attacks with this on will instantly kill the monster hitscanned in front of the player.  Activate again for Instagib mode to gib monsters when killed.  Fires every 1 second.  Consumes no ammo and does not fire your actual weapon.  Powered by lightning from on high. (NOTE: Intended for testing monsters and verifying gibs match skinned variants.... and for Qmaster's new Instakill speedrun type for those paying attention)</td></tr><tr><td>239</td><td>Jumpboots.  Grant yourself double jump.</td></tr><tr><td>249</td><td>CheatCommand. Gives all runes, full ammo of every type, full red armor, and all weapons except overrides.

Within these dusty pages you may find a detailed technical explanation of what I have discovered and kept on my many travels in the land of Quake.\n\nWhat started as an effort to add a few items from both mission packs into one single player level eventually grew over time to be a massive compilation of features from across the Quake community.\nThis mod for the first [Quake (1996)](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake) is primarily a full combination of the following mods’ enemies, weapons, items, traps, and other features in addition to\nmy own features:\n* Standard Quake (ID1)........[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake)]\n* Mission Pack 1 (Hipnotic)...[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake_Mission_Pack_1:_Scourge_of_Armagon)]\n* Mission Pack 2 (Rogue)......[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake_Mission_Pack_2:_Dissolution_of_Eternity)]\n* Arcane Dimensions (AD) [[link](http://www.simonoc.com/pages/design/sp/ad.htm)] [[mirror](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/ad_v1_80p1final.html)]\n* Drake (SOE, etc.) [[link](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/something_wicked.html)]\n* Quoth [[quoth 1](https://www.quaddicted.com/webarchive/kell.quaddicted.com/) [[quoth 2.2](https://tomeofpreach.wordpress.com/quoth/)]\n* Kinn (Marcher, etc.) [[marcher](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/kinn_marcher.html) [[bastion](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/kinn_bastion.html)]\n* Custents [[link](https://www.quakewiki.net/quake-1/mods/custents-custom-entities/)]\n* extras_r5 [[link](https://github.com/khreathor/extras_r5)] [[extras_r4 (older)](https://www.quakewiki.net/quake-1/mods/extras-r4/)] [[docs](http://khreathor.xyz/jam/extras/index.html)]\n* Nehahra [[link](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/nehahra.html)]\n* Rubicon and Rubicon 2 [[rubicon](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/rubicon.html)] [[rubicon2](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/rubicon2.html)] [[rrp](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/rrp.html)]\n* Other various community contributions, refer to the Credits\n\n\nArcane Dimensions serves as the primary base for all added content due to its excellent formatting, enhanced enemy infighting code, and excellent structure.\n\nAny conflicts have been resolved in such a manner as to retain the unique features of the primary mods above, for instance by using spawnflags, such that any mod's conflicting variant is avaialable.\nThe entity definition file (.fgd) contains all the necessary fields and spawnflags for accessing these conflict resolving features as well as any Keep specific features that have been added.\n\nAll features of this mod are documented here in their various sections.  A complete entity list can be found in the appendix.  In every section the entities are listed alphabetically by entity name.\n\nFor what is and isn't implemented, refer to the [Checklist](https://github.com/JosiahJack/Keep/blob/master/KeepFeatureChecklist.xlsx)\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe purpose of this mod is to provide a toolset for creating any kind of Quake\nmap you desire with anything you may have encountered in some of the best known\nmods.  This mod is a mod for mappers, intended for mappers to make excellent\nmaps for players to play.  Also, in the spirit of the earliest days of Quake,\nthis mod is not striving for overall quality, nor quantity, but is intending to\nprovide fun.  Some content is intentionally as-is, in terms of quality, to\npreserve the old-school 90's feel; other content is much more polished.  The\nquality of content you use is up to you, the mapper.\n\n> The mapper is always right.  The player is at the mercy of the mapper.\n\n# TABLE OF CONTENTS\nHere are links to each book within the tome.\n\n* [[general]]\n* [[credits]]\n* [[enemies]]\n* [[weapons]]\n* [[items]]\n* [[traps]]\n* [[brush-entities]]\n* [[point-entities]]\n* [[requirements]]\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nDISCLAIMERS:\nThe contents herein may have originally derived from other authors.  I make no claim that the full contents are an original work, rather only the compilation as such is original.  Please refer to the\nSource Mod specified on each item's listing and refer to the credits folder for the original authors of some content.
