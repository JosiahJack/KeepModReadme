# Credits 
Since this is a compilation mod, it has had development by a large number of different people over the past 25 years of Quake modding history.  I have attempted to be thorough here, no etc.'s allowed, but please email me if I left your name out of this list.  Also of note, I have included all the various readmes from the different mods used in Keep into the `keep/credits` folder.
