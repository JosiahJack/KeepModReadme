# Weapons
There are numerous weapons available.  Below is a chart listing each weapon
with its stats.  The impulse value given below is the internal number used by
the code to switch to that weapon; this can be used via the console by entering
`impulse ###` console command and replacing \### with the desired number from
below to switch directly to that weapon without the need for pressing a slot's
keyboard key multiple times.  Also possible to add new keybinds for specific
weapons by adding `"bind" "keyhere" "impulse ###"` in your config.cfg file and
changing "keyhere" to desired keyboard key.  The weapon has to have been picked
up first.

Further down is a chart listing the keyboard key defaults for each weapon 'slot'
and the weapons in that slot.  Pressing the keyboard key will first switch to
the first weapon in the slot that the player has in inventory; further presses
of the same key will cycle through the weapons in the slot.

### Overrides

Some weapons are _override_ weapons.  An override will fully replace a weapon
in its slot, for instance the Shadow Axe replaces the standard Axe.  The
following overrides are not given by CheatCommand since they don't always apply
to every map (refer to [Cheat Codes](8.5-Cheat-Codes.md) for more info):
* [Laser Blaster](3.3-weapon_blaster.md)
* [Chainsaw](3.5-weapon_chainsaw.md)
* [MIRV Launcher](3.17-weapon_mirv.md)
* [Plasma Gun](3.32-weapon_upgrade_lg.md)
* [Chaingun](3.36-weapon_zerchain.md)
* [Riot Controller](3.37-weapon_zershot.md)

NOTE: The [Widowmaker](3.33-weapon_upgrade_ssg.md) _is_ given since it is too
awesome not to and suits any theme.
