<h1 id="triggers">Triggers<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#triggers"></a></h1>
<p>Triggers are brush based entities that are invisible and non-solid as far as
allowing all objects to pass through them.  Whenever an entity would have
touched it if it were solid, then it causes its <code>touch</code> function to run.  This
is used to trigger events.  This could be as mundane as the typical target IO,
perform a special action, or acting upon the entities that touched it.</p>
<p>There is no real limit to what behavior a trigger can have or on who or what
can trigger it.  Different triggers are normally configured to be either player
only, monster only, projectile only, or some combination.</p>

<p>Specialty particles and emitters that react to physics, and their affectors.</p>
<p>Particle systems with QuakeC - packet overflows made easy!
These were modeled after particle systems in high-end 3D apps, they are not
the most user friendly entities around...</p>
<p>EMITTER ENTITIES: func_emitter, func_emitter_volume
EFFECTOR TRIGGERS: t_effector_destroy, t_effector_push, t_effector_gravity,
t_effector_trubulence, t_effector_attract, t_effector_friction</p>
<p>Emitters generate a "particle" (either a .spr, .mdl or .bsp) and toss it in
a direction between the set angle limits. They can use an optional "death"
model to simulate anything from rain, falling rubble, blasts of flames,
forcefields, whatever...</p>
<p>Effectors change the behaviour of particles that touch them (the emitter
must have the "USEEFFECTORS" spawnflag set).  Emitters can be attached to a
func_train_ext, for some really neat crap :)</p>
<p>Don't go too nuts with these, stay away from the built-in sounds for high
frequency emitters (use fx_sound instead) and just use common sense (you
don't need a gib fountain around every corner!).  Fine Tronyn...do whatever!</p>
<p>There are a LOT of options - these are really generic and need to be
tailored to specifc purposes.</p>
<p>The lifespan of animated particles may not be exact - it will always fall on
a multiple of the framerate (this usually isn't a problem, since framerates
are typically much smaller than lifespans) but you should be aware of this
limitation.</p>
<p>Particles won't "die" when they hit another particle - this is on purpose.</p>
<p>Particles don't register a touch on water, but a t_effector_destroy trigger
can be used to simulate this. Set KILLINFWATER to have them die in
func_water volumes.</p>
<p>ANGLES EXPLAINED:
The angle limits may take a while to get used to, but it's a really powerful
way to control the direction and spread. Start by setting just v1 and h1 to
get a tight stream in the general direction, then adjust v1/v2 and h1/h2 to
within a few degrees (plus and minus) of the original value to increase the
spread for a cone-shaped fountain. Ommit either h2 or v2 for a fan shaped
emission, or set v1=1 v2=360 h1=1 h2=360 for a fire-works style spherical
burst.</p>
<p>The following diagram visualizes the horizontal and vertical angle relationship.</p>
<p><img src="/KeepModReadme/assets/img/emitter_angles.gif" alt="Emitter Angles"></p>
<p>When viewing a map from the top, an H angle value of 270 points up, and
moves clockwise, making right 360 (or 0), down 90 and left 180. Same goes
for the V angle when viewed from the front.</p>
<p>The particle spread is always contained from the first angle (h1/v1) to the
second angle (h2/v2), going clockwise. So h1=10 h2=350 is NOT the same as
h1=350 h2=10. (the first is a near circular spread, while the second is a
tight 20ยบ fan shaped spread).</p>
<p>Also note that although 0 would normally be a valid replacement for 360, you
should use a range of 1 - 360 as a value of 0 is simply ignored (though this
may be desirable in certain situations).</p>
