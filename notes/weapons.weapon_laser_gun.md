### `weapon_laser_gun`

### Normal Effects
Fires lasers in an alternating pattern of 2 blasts at once then 1 blast.
Lasers ricochet off walls up to 3 times but lose 10% damage with each ricochet
with a 15% chance of not ricocheting.  Very rapid fire. Hipnotic originally 
only gave 15 cells with pickup; increased since 15 cells would run out very
rapidly in cell starved maps.

### Tome of Power Effects
Double damage and flings out sparks.
