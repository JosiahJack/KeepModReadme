Since this is a compilation mod, it has had development by a large number of different people over the past 25 years of Quake modding history.  I have attempted to be thorough here, no etc.'s allowed, but please email me if I left your name out of this list.  Also of note, I have included all the various readmes from the different mods used in Keep into the `keep/credits` folder.

The credits listed below were taken from the respective readmes of each release
or in cases where no readme was present from the sources I obtained them from.

Care has been taken to include all names and teams credited in each respective
mod within the `Per Project Credit Listing` below to ensure that each mod has
its credits intact.

The full name listing below is the complete compilation of all individuals
named who contributed to any of the mods and projects included, no matter how
trivial there contribution.  In some respects this will be a (not comprehensive
but quite large) list of people who have touched Quake in significant ways over
these many years since 1996.

## Sourced Projects/Mods List Alphabatized
Please note this excludes single authors releasing files individually (e.g.
Madfox).  For that see the authors list at the bottom of the page.  Some of
these are single map releases.  This lists all mods used in full or in part,
even if just one file or sky was used, even if not implemented and files are
available for later planned implementation.

Also note that while a mod is listed, it may only have contributed a tiny part
to Keep and may not be fully subsumed into the collective as of yet.

Parentheses contain the abbreviation commonly associated with a project.

## Per Project Credit Listing
Here I provide the credits for each mod as provided at the time of mod release
from the mods' documentation.  Please note this is the people, not the mods.
There is some recursion here as mods build on each other.

The mods here are listed alphabetically with the exception of AD.  Within each
mod the names are listed as they are found in the mod's documentation or as I
discovered it.
