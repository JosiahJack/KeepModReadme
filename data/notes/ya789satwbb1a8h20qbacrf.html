<p> The Anaconda monster created as a demo in anticipation of the movie of the
same name. (This may or may not be a reskin of the Virtus CD lava worm).</p>
<p> Also has <a href="/KeepModReadme/notes/rh91b0mqdn3cgatycf68366">Anaconda Coil</a> that are to simulate the Anaconda being intertwined through
the level.</p>
<p>Large snake enemy.  Usually used as a boss, though is able to be used multiple times.  Intended to be trapped in a liquid (uses lava splash effect) with minimum depth of 32 and that has an alpha of 1.0 - dives when player is out of sight and the re-emerges later to surprise player.  Needs 368 units of overhead height above the liquid and 80 units of side clearance both to avoid model appearing to go through walls/ceiling.</p>
