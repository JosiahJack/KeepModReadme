<h1 id="behavior">Behavior<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#behavior"></a></h1>
<p>Enemy behavior in original Quake is largely simplistic.  See a player, get
angry at the player, chase the player in a straight line for indefinite amount
of time.  If the enemy bumped walls, they would search for 5 seconds in one
randomly picked direction either left or right.  If hurt, they would get angry
at whoever hurt them unless they had the same classname.  This behavior is
still preserved when no changes or customizations have been made.</p>
<p>One exception is that monsters now look for any other opposing monster or
player, not just players.  See Alignment below.</p>
<h2 id="basic-overview">Basic Overview<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#basic-overview"></a></h2>
<p>It is possible to make numerous customizations to enemy behavior.  We have 3
variables that determine behavior on a monster:</p>
<ul>
<li>alignment</li>
<li>temperament</li>
<li>vulnerability</li>
</ul>
<p>All 3 can be changed by the mapper per monster.
All monsters default to 0 for all 3, which is Evil Angry Normal.</p>
