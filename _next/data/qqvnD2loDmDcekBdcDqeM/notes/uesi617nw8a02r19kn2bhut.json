One of Keep's mantras is that \"the mapper is always right\", and thus Keep allows you to use a monster however you want, with or without special setup.\nHistorically, bosses in Quake have been used in special setups, alone or with underlings.  Keep makes it such that any monster can be used as a normal enemy or a boss.</p>\n<p>Any monster can be a boss, it merely depends on the context. It is also possible to override default monster values such as <code>health</code> and <code>deathstring</code>.  <code>deathstring</code> should start with a space and reference being killed by the monsters <code>netname</code>.  For instance <code>\" was tusk-skewered by a raging Wildebeast.\"</code> (without quotes when entered in the map editor).  This gets put in a statement immediately after the player's netname in the displayed message at the top of the screen whenever the player dies, example: <code>Ranger was tusk-skewered by a raging Wildebeast.</code> </p>\n<h2 id=\"purpose-of-this-page\">Purpose of This Page<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#purpose-of-this-page\"></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Show what is somewhat hidden: Many bosses are simply variants of existing enemies and are only able to be used by placing a normal enemy and then checking the appropriate spawnflag.

Within these dusty pages you may find a detailed technical explanation of what I have discovered and kept on my many travels in the land of Quake.\n\nWhat started as an effort to add a few items from both mission packs into one single player level eventually grew over time to be a massive compilation of features from across the Quake community.\nThis mod for the first [Quake (1996)](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake) is primarily a full combination of the following mods’ enemies, weapons, items, traps, and other features in addition to\nmy own features:\n* Standard Quake (ID1)........[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake)]\n* Mission Pack 1 (Hipnotic)...[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake_Mission_Pack_1:_Scourge_of_Armagon)]\n* Mission Pack 2 (Rogue)......[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake_Mission_Pack_2:_Dissolution_of_Eternity)]\n* Arcane Dimensions (AD) [[link](http://www.simonoc.com/pages/design/sp/ad.htm)] [[mirror](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/ad_v1_80p1final.html)]\n* Drake (SOE, etc.) [[link](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/something_wicked.html)]\n* Quoth [[quoth 1](https://www.quaddicted.com/webarchive/kell.quaddicted.com/) [[quoth 2.2](https://tomeofpreach.wordpress.com/quoth/)]\n* Kinn (Marcher, etc.) [[marcher](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/kinn_marcher.html) [[bastion](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/kinn_bastion.html)]\n* Custents [[link](https://www.quakewiki.net/quake-1/mods/custents-custom-entities/)]\n* extras_r5 [[link](https://github.com/khreathor/extras_r5)] [[extras_r4 (older)](https://www.quakewiki.net/quake-1/mods/extras-r4/)] [[docs](http://khreathor.xyz/jam/extras/index.html)]\n* Nehahra [[link](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/nehahra.html)]\n* Rubicon and Rubicon 2 [[rubicon](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/rubicon.html)] [[rubicon2](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/rubicon2.html)] [[rrp](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/rrp.html)]\n* Other various community contributions, refer to the Credits\n\n\nArcane Dimensions serves as the primary base for all added content due to its excellent formatting, enhanced enemy infighting code, and excellent structure.\n\nAny conflicts have been resolved in such a manner as to retain the unique features of the primary mods above, for instance by using spawnflags, such that any mod's conflicting variant is avaialable.\nThe entity definition file (.fgd) contains all the necessary fields and spawnflags for accessing these conflict resolving features as well as any Keep specific features that have been added.\n\nAll features of this mod are documented here in their various sections.  A complete entity list can be found in the appendix.  In every section the entities are listed alphabetically by entity name.\n\nFor what is and isn't implemented, refer to the [Checklist](https://github.com/JosiahJack/Keep/blob/master/KeepFeatureChecklist.xlsx)\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe purpose of this mod is to provide a toolset for creating any kind of Quake\nmap you desire with anything you may have encountered in some of the best known\nmods.  This mod is a mod for mappers, intended for mappers to make excellent\nmaps for players to play.  Also, in the spirit of the earliest days of Quake,\nthis mod is not striving for overall quality, nor quantity, but is intending to\nprovide fun.  Some content is intentionally as-is, in terms of quality, to\npreserve the old-school 90's feel; other content is much more polished.  The\nquality of content you use is up to you, the mapper.\n\n> The mapper is always right.  The player is at the mercy of the mapper.\n\n# TABLE OF CONTENTS\nHere are links to each book within the tome.\n\n* [[general]]\n* [[credits]]\n* [[enemies]]\n* [[weapons]]\n* [[items]]\n* [[traps]]\n* [[brush-entities]]\n* [[point-entities]]\n* [[requirements]]\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nDISCLAIMERS:\nThe contents herein may have originally derived from other authors.  I make no claim that the full contents are an original work, rather only the compilation as such is original.
