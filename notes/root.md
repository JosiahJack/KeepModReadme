Welcome weary traveler!  Within these dusty pages you may find a detailed technical explanation of what I have discovered and kept on my many travels in the land of Quake.

What started as an effort to add a few items from both mission packs into one single player level eventually grew over time to be a massive compilation of features from across the Quake community.
This mod for the first [Quake (1996)](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake) is primarily a full combination of the following modsâ€™ enemies, weapons, items, traps, and other features in addition to
my own features:
* Standard Quake (ID1)........[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake)]
* Mission Pack 1 (Hipnotic)...[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake_Mission_Pack_1:_Scourge_of_Armagon)]
* Mission Pack 2 (Rogue)......[[link](https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake_Mission_Pack_2:_Dissolution_of_Eternity)]
* Arcane Dimensions (AD) [[link](http://www.simonoc.com/pages/design/sp/ad.htm)] [[mirror](https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/ad_v1_80p1final.html)]

Arcane Dimensions serves as the primary base for all added content due to its excellent formatting, enhanced enemy infighting code, and excellent structure.

Any conflicts have been resolved in such a manner as to retain the unique features of the primary mods above, for instance by using spawnflags, such that any mod's conflicting variant is avaialable.
The entity definition file (.fgd) contains all the necessary fields and spawnflags for accessing these conflict resolving features as well as any Keep specific features that have been added.

All features of this mod are documented here in their various sections.  A complete entity list can be found in the appendix.  In every section the entities are listed alphabetically by entity name.
