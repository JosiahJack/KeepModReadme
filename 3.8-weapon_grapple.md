#### `weapon_grapple`

### Normal Effects
Shoots out a hook with a cable.  Once the claw hits a solid surface, it pulls
the player to it.  Enemies are pulled instead if they are lower mass.  Enemies
are hurt by the claw.  If weapons are switched when the player has reached the
claw, player stays aloft. Useful to slow fall speed to prevent falling damage.

### Tome of Power Effects
