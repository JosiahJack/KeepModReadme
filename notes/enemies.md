The enemies of Quake, commonly referred to as monsters, are many and varied.  Keep contains support for almost 200 different enemies.  Many have alternate skins or upgraded versions such as the ogre family, death knight brigade, grunts, and enforcers.  Here, all attributes and options for how to use enemies in the Keep mod are listed and explained.  I use the term _attribute_ to describe both `key|value` pairs and spawn flag options (technically `spawnflags` is itself a `key` with a `value`).  All enemies can be placed as-is without setting or changing any attributes, including bosses.  Most other mods require special setups for their bosses but Keep allows any enemy to be used as if it were a normal monster.  Special boss setups are still supported.
